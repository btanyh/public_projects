40,A one on one sword fight with Ganondorf easily my favorite boss in the franchise,11423,gaming,12va6oo,https://i.redd.it/ljhusamm1iva1.jpg,502,Super badass to use the sword they tried to execute you with.
41,A one on one sword fight with Ganondorf easily my favorite boss in the franchise,11423,gaming,12va6oo,https://i.redd.it/ljhusamm1iva1.jpg,502,The final battle sequence in Twilight Princess is my fav in the series.

44,A one on one sword fight with Ganondorf easily my favorite boss in the franchise,11423,gaming,12va6oo,https://i.redd.it/ljhusamm1iva1.jpg,502,"This design of Ganondorf is my favorite. There is such strong notes of Darth Vader but his stance with a sword is reminiscent of a duelist using a one handed sword. The amount of strength required to hold what appears to be a two handed sword, one handed, excellently illustrates how physically strong Ganondorf is, though this is in no small part thanks to the Triforce of power.

The series of fights with Ganondorf as he possessed Zelda, became a huge beast, battled on horseback, and finally the final confrontation is something I wish more action adventure games did. The atmosphere sold it so well too.

Also the hero of twilight is honestly one of the best heroes too. Iirc only the hero of time would be comparable to twilight hero."

47,A one on one sword fight with Ganondorf easily my favorite boss in the franchise,11423,gaming,12va6oo,https://i.redd.it/ljhusamm1iva1.jpg,502,"It’s good, but I preferred the Wind Waker fight where he dual wields and blocks with the swords like the gerudo guards from OOT. Super cool callback"
48,A one on one sword fight with Ganondorf easily my favorite boss in the franchise,11423,gaming,12va6oo,https://i.redd.it/ljhusamm1iva1.jpg,502,This right here felt so rewarding after learning all the sword combat skills throughout the game. In this moment you’re just in awe of all the ways you can kick his ass.
49,A one on one sword fight with Ganondorf easily my favorite boss in the franchise,11423,gaming,12va6oo,https://i.redd.it/ljhusamm1iva1.jpg,502,One of the many reasons this is my favorite Zelda game.

Finally took some time to draw the most highly requested Final Fantasy character! 🔥✨ Vivi has such a great design and I wanted to capture him in a cool but playful pose.

I will be completing the other characters for all my Final Fantasy series sporadically throughout the year instead of a continuous straight shot. So no worries on Zidane and FFVIII characters, they will be done later on✨

Next I’ll be preparing new work for the release of Zelda Tears of the Kingdom and Final Fantasy XVI. I’m going to focus heavily on doing a good series for both to celebrate their releases. Also will be doing some more Spiderverse as the movie drops.🙌✨

This will be the busiest next few months for me and I’m so ready for it. I’ll share as much as I can and keep the hype going!

Let me know what you guys think and if you'd like to see more!^^"

The Sindarin VO DLC can also be bought separately if you opt for the base game. Additionally, it clarified that even without the DLC, Elves will still speak Sindarin on occasion.

I remember my first being Halo 2, and from there it became an almost regular thing, a few times a year for the next 8-10 years or so for me at least. The last I went to was Dark Souls 2. 

My local GameStop staff was a lot of fun. For some of the slightly smaller releases they’d get pizzas for everyone and it’d just turn into a small party of people playing games at the store until midnight.

I remember when scalpers were scalping the Wii!

The pandemic contributed many factors that made the scalping situation far, far worse:

* Folks forced to stay home sought out more in-home entertainment, which increased demand for consoles
* Folks in China forced to stay home frequently couldn't work in the factories that provide components and assemble the consoles, which decreased supply
* Folks forced to stay home also meant no live entertainment and sports events, so many of the scalpers who'd normally scalp those tickets decided to get into scalping consoles instead, which increased the number of scalpers
* Under normal circumstances, gamers can tell scalpers to take a hike and still get a console by standing in line at 5AM at their nearest electronics store. (That's how I got my Wii and my Switch.) Pandemic protocols prevented or discouraged most retailers from offering that.

The above four factors created a perfect storm for high-demand electronics.

Barring another pandemic (God forbid!) I don't see the scalping turning out quite so bad for the next console generation."

I just want to clarify one huge misconception though. There are cynical people here who argue Sony and Microsoft don't give a crap about scalpers because ""they got their sales lol"". But that's not true at all. If 2,000 actual people buy a PS5, they're not just going to buy the console; they'll buy additional games, or peripherals, and some will get a PSN subscription as well. This is all additional revenue. Moreover, once they have a console they are going to naturally acquire more games over time.

If a scalper buys 2,000 PS5s, he's not going to do anything with them. Even if he only holds them for a week before reselling, that's a week where 2,000 *actual* customers aren't buying games, controllers or PSN. Moreover, if they're spending twice as much to buy the console there's a good chance they will delay, or straight up abandon the purchase of supporting hardware and software.

So scalpers hurt *everyone* in the supply chain. They damage the company's ability to make money, and they damage the customer's ability to access product. It is in the interest of both parties for scalpers to be purged from the process."

So my question is do you badly need a PS5 that much your willing to pay 200 bucks exstra ?  I mean sure you got the money to fling around but damn have some dignity and learn to wait.

The Legend of Heroes: Trails has the story, roster, and enemy variety for it.

League of Legends has a huge roster, designated mooks, and bases to attack/defend. It would give me a reason to care about the universe outside of Arcane again.

Yakuza already kinda plays like one, so a musou would just take the beat em up cheese up to 11.

I prefer musous when they are a bit more tactical, like the Fire Emblem ones, so other strategy RPG franchises like Langrisser, Shining Force, and Disgaea would be very welcome.

Nintendo franchises have always gotten more care with their Warriors games, so Xenoblade and Golden Sun would be great. And also a Fire Emblem one with a good roster this time."

Here are some things I learned about myself:

1. Sleep on it: ever had a section where you didn’t progress at all and decided after trying a thousand times that going to bed was the best thing to do and the next day beat the section on the first try?

2. The journey is the reward: often times you feel great when beating a game but won’t touch it ever again. It was the journey, beating bosses and learning the mechanics of the game, that made it fun.

3. Doing is more rewarding than seeing: compare the emotional moments you have while gaming versus those while watching TV. It is exactly like that: Go out and participate and life is more fun. 

4. Own what you decide: There was a time I would reload a game when I wasn’t happy with my decisions. But then it bothered me and felt like cheating. I learned that I was getting better in making quick decisions and sticking with them. Experiencing their consequences."

Minority Report is a bad example, it used excessive bloom as an art direction in the cinematography. Contemporary movies didn't do this.

Games did it because Shader Model 1.x was a thing and it could run small pixel shaders which could detect highlights and bloom them. Jade Empire was probably the most egregious case I'm aware of.

Then, Shader Model 2.0 came around with FP24 operations, enabling high dynamic range lighting. Bloom and HDR became almost synonymous, as seen in games like Oblivion."

In an earlier comment I explained the reasons as to why the game technically failed. A death in the team, a pushing publisher and the game being way too advanced for most home pc's at that time.

A few other reasons why there was a never a sequel is that most of the original team disbanded and moved on to other projects. The rights of the game are still with Interplay but the IP is in hands of a holding company. De original devs don't own any of the rights to their own assets currently. 

That being said. During the 20th anniversary of the game we got to play and chat with the original developers. I would love to post a link to that video but I don't know if my comment will get deleted if I do that.

There is still interest and thoughts about making a sequel. Or at the very least a similar game. They tried in 2015 with a game called First Wonder, which unfortunately failed on kickstarter. After that they went of to other projects, because quite literally, funds were running dry. They signed up with the Amico Intellivision to make a console exclusive Earthworm Jim remake to replenish their funds. It seems that never got off the ground or was cancelled entirely somewhere down the line between 2018 and now. 

For Giants. The Multiplayer community is still alive after 23 years. We host games every week and have an active Discord. A V1.5 Community patch was released by us a few years ago to keep the game running on modern machines and give it some much needed graphical upgrades.

Again, I won't post links or invites but a quick google search will get you to our GiantsWD Forums where you can find the rest.

Glad to see there are always people around who randomly think fondly of this game!"

I love the old classics, but they're all still there to play and we're getting new games many of which are great games. On top of that, we've also got the indie scene providing small to mid sized games that can feel a lot like old school games.

Plus as a PC gamer, exclusives are becoming less of a thing as both Sony and Microsoft are porting more and more stuff to Windows. Unfortunately they're still at odds with each other on the Xbox vs PlayStation thing."

These games go on sale regulary from what I have seen.

Usually when Steam sales are all other sites etc put these games on sale as well and with digital products especially games they usually only get cheaper the older they get.

Not sure what you mean with tracking game prices as in only official stores or not but you could also try to look up key seller sites for comparison as they are sometimes even cheaper.

I think one or both Revelations games were in some bundles sometimes back so you can find some of the keys for cheap on the internet.

It looks like there is a pretty steep jump in price for graded copies, even in the ~B grade copies. Read up on video game grading if you haven't before (ie it's a collusive scam designed to drive up prices that's still succeeding.)

May be able to find a private collector who is willing to pay the higher, graded prices without going through the trouble. 

Check I to some price histories online, figure out a price fair to the actual condition of the piece that you would sell for, then head to some collector subs/discord channels, maybe look for dedicated Panzer Dragoon communities and see if anyone wants to buy for your price.

Good luck with the sale and the heating. It's expensive and cold out there."

I, and I bet a ton of non-native speakers around my age, learned a lot of English from text in videogames like (in my case) Pokemon on the Gameboy. This means you have to figure out how to pronounce words you never heard spoken to talk with your friends about the games, and you'll use the rules of your own native tongue or you take a guess based on the small amount of words you already know.

Needless to say English is a TERRIBLE language to learn this way and I've had many mistakes pointed out to me, basically up to this day (I'm in my thirties). My own favourite: I pronounced ""health"" like ""heat"" with an L until I was like 15."

The only interpretation I can think of that makes sense where god loves us is because god wants to see us grow and prosper but also that our material lives are only an exceptionally small part of our entire existence and thus only meaningful in the choices we make during it.

All the blood, sweat, anguish, frustration, despair, and hopelessness we experience means the world to us now because it's all we've ever known but once we die all the worst parts become meaningless and we get whatever we've earned.

Or god is a sick fuck and wants us to suffer because it's what gives him meaning in life.

Or there is no god and we're just all angsty molecules trying to make sense of completely random chaos."

I try too to make a schedule for the day full of distractions- so it might be like wake up, work out, get breakfast out, clean house, get lunch out, see a movie, go to library, get dinner, go on a walk, bed. Just as long as I’m moving myself to different activities, otherwise I will stay in my bed and rot. 

Lastly. Activities can be money. I try my best to be budget friendly. Library is free, beaches and parks aren’t too pricey. I have a movie pass where I pay $20 a month and can see as many movies as I want with that pass. So that helps some too. Sometimes I’ll treat myself to a new restaurant but sometimes dinner looks like using the McDonald’s app or getting a lunchable just to be cost effective but get me out of the house. 

Oh also I answered this in terms of, if you’re like me and sad and can’t hang out with people right now but need ideas to distract. That being said if you want to meet people- like others have said, volunteering, joining a church if you’re religious, seeing if there are classes at a community center near you that you could take, joining a workout group- all ways to meet people if you’re the opposite of me and want to see people!

And try to remember that you are not alone okay, I know it can be so hard. Hope things get easier soon"

It really reminded me of the list of cult like traits.



Any time someone asked them a difficult question or who didn't immediately accept their premise was berated by the young women in the group (opposition to critical analysis)

At one point one of them got annoyed and announced she was leaving, she was told that if she doesn't start acting respectful she'd be asked to sit in the van, when she did leave there was a phonecall to a professor. (Separating and penalizing members for insubordination/leaving)

Whenever they did get someone talking they repeated the same thing over and over, citing the same things with no evidence or citations in any way.  (Obsession with doctrine)

I heard them say a lot of interesting things but one of the most fascinating was how they fawned over random politicians and celebrities, often using them as examples. (Inappropriate loyalty to leaders or figures in power)

Many of them drew from their own experiences while talking and shared how they had cut contact with family members for not having the same views as them (Encouraging breaking of a familial unit)

They talked a lot about fairness and deservedness, including making things public and accessible rather than being individually owned  and how sometimes violence is justified (crossing socially accepted boundaries of behaviour)


And they talked about how people should be seperate from the state and the people should own the means of production (seperation from an established governing body)"

Similarly with buying odd numbers of cheap beer. A friend asks you to swing by the store on your way over and pick up 3 cans of cheap beer. It looks like you're spending your last money for alcohol."

My wife and I weren't adverse to it, and I think we only did it once each with our oldest. It's really the nuclear option in dealing with children...there are so many other ways to punish a kid before that's the only remaining choice.

Such techniques may require you to stay there with your kid, though, and I think some parents who approve of corporal punishment do so because it is a ""fire and forget"" approach. You hit the kid until they cry. You've now ""broken"" them, and can send them somewhere, and don't have to think about them again and go back to whatever you want to do. They don't see the inherent neglect in this approach, and the abuse involved in getting to the ""something to cry about"" stage. It isn't a wake-up to a child to spank them in such a way; there are other ways to make clear that you are disappointed and that they did wrong, they just require your attention.

In short, corporal punishment is lazy parenting."

1. My job is teach my son to act as a reasonable person and work things out non-violently. I think it sends a mixed message to the child that “hey you need to act like a reasonable person and not be violent in your problem solving and to reinforce that I’m going to hit you”. Yeah no! 

2. I will never strike child while angry or in the heat of the moment. I won’t have control I won’t be able to regulate my feelings. It will it teach them to hit while angry which is so not good.

(Context: young adults)

Currently more people are becoming aware that the life outside of social media and devices is better experienced than on them, which is where i believe that people will start to go out more and enjoy life, as sitting inside a room all day watching youtube is starting to bore people now that the pandemic is gone.

This is something i believe will become a \~40/60 rate, which is better than the current \~30/70 rate currently seen.

AI will be stronger, obviously. IMO this will exacerbate class division. There will also be tiered subscription programs to different quality AI solutions. More affordable software will be weaker. The most expensive will be nearly indistinguishable from people. 

AI assisted terrorism will become the norm. 

In response to this, tech security will grow into an even larger business. Will be interesting to see how education programs perform as securities and bad actors race to outpace each other. 

There’s going to be a lot less biodiversity. It’s already happening. The drop-dead due date for meaningful action has passed us. And the ambitions of lesser developed nations mean that resource extraction will continue, causing environmental harm. 

I firmly believe we will see a generation of western kids react against tech and go full-on IRL. Being IRL will be seen as hip. Social media will be dead. Arcane shit like letter writing and postage and paper will see new popularity. Think: hipsters but a weird blend of 90s and Amish. 

James Cameron will have just released Avatar IX: The Weight of Gold. The subtitle refers to his wealth being equivalent to the total weight of his global audience in gold. 

Tech will become way more integrated. Goodbye phone. There’s a financial interest in making the hardware part of your body so that you can never put it down. You can never fully escape the ads. (Unless you can pay for ad-free or LITE ads, of course.) 

Weather will be fucked. Two season in most of the US: Blazing summer and wet, grey winter. Out west, it’s fire season, baby, ALL year long. 

In my dream future, all of OPEC is financially destabilized because we adopted enough electric and other alternatives to stop letting corrupt monarchies get away with sponsoring terrorism and killing journalists.

Not exaggerating, they left unexpectedly after 4 years and we had just moved into a new house 


I couldnt sleep or eat

I had to get a job quickly and it happened to be a restaurant and the other girls that worked there noticed I never ate, which is weird in a restaurant and at first they thought I was poor and tried to buy me food and of course I refused

So then they just started coming and sitting with me on their breaks and they would just be like ""here have a bite of this it's really good"" 

No joke they mommed me back to life

They also sat me down and told me my clothes were way too big now and I needed to fix it

I genuienly didnt realize how much weight I lost (it was 60 pounds in like 4 months, yeah I was super chubby) and was just walking around in clothes that fell off basically

It was a bad time

But I got better

If you've never worked food you wouldnt understand but food service workers really do look after each other, we've fought so many battles together and gotten thru so many bad nights together we cant help it, and it was food service workers who pulled me out of the darkest time of my life, one bite of barbeque at a time"

He was taken prisoner when the Japanese invaded the island during the Battle of Singapore, which lasted from December 1941 to February 1942. He was sent to work on the Burma Railway, referred to as ""Death Railway"" because of the tens of thousands of forced labourers who died during its construction. While working on the railway Urquhart suffered from malnutrition, cholera and torture at the hands of his captors.

After working on the railway and in the docks in Singapore, Urquhart was loaded into the hold of the Kachidoki Maru, an American passenger and cargo ship captured by the Japanese and put to use work (these were nicknamed Hell Ships) transporting hundreds of prisoners. The ship was part of a convoy bound for Japan; on the voyage prisoners endured more illness, and instances of cannibalism. On 12 September 1944, the ship was torpedoed and sunk by the US submarine USS Pampanito, whose commander was unaware of its cargo of prisoners. Urquhart was burned and covered in oil when the ship went down, and swallowed some oil which caused permanent damage to his vocal cords.He floated in a single-man raft for five days without food or water before being picked up by a Japanese whaling ship. In Japan, Urquhart was sent to work in coal mines and later a labour camp ten miles from Nagasaki. He was there when the city was hit with the atomic bomb 

He was released at the end of the war and lived until his death in 2016 at the age of 97

If women have this mindset, they won't 'settle' for anything less than perfect. Therefore won't have kids, and will end up alone in their 40s.

Family is living next to some older, creepy guy called Harry Street. They're just going about their lives, but Street insists that their children are insulting him and making names plus playing too loudly in their garden. ""That can't be right,"" the dad insists, ""they don't go out of their way to scream or insult people.""

The timeline doesn't fit - insisting they were out playing when they were nowhere near the house and such. Family decides to ignore it or try and settle the matter in a civilized manner.

But after overhearing Harry make a particularly vile threat towards the lives of their children, they call the police and ask for protection against Harry. Since this is the British police, they're limited by what they're allowed to do and say that they should gather evidence and keep records of when Harry makes threats against them.

But a junior officer thinks something is wrong and decides to do a background check on Harry Street. In doing so, she discovers that Street has no legal records dating to before the 1990's. This serves as an immediate red flag to the junior officer who immediately insists that they need to dig further into his history.

A few hours later, said junior officer calls up the family right in the middle of the night and while they are sleeping in order to tell them to *GET THE FUCK OUT OF THAT HOUSE IMMEDIATELY AND GET TO SOMEWHERE HARRY DOESN'T KNOW ABOUT*. Because as the junior officer had discovered, due to the changeover from paper records to digital computer databases and some paperwork slipping through the cracks...

The police had lost track of a *paranoid-schizophrenic* ***spree killer!***

""Harry Street"" was actually a man named Barry Williams who, in the 1970's, had hallucinated that his neighbours were insulting him behind his back and making an absurd amount of noise. Williams had also had a history of disturbing behaviour; at least one gun club that he was a member of had expelled him under the suspicion of stealing ammunition and another was planning on doing the same for modifying bullets to have more force behind them, as well as decorating targets and mannequins to look like people he had grudges against.

One evening, he committed a familicide against his neighbours and went on a rampage which ended with his arrest, eventually being found incompetent to stand trial due to his insanity and held in a mental institution until he had received treatment. And his behaviour as of recent was eerily similar to how he acted before he lost it before.

After the new family evacuated their home, armed response kicked in Williams' door and arrested him due to fears he was about to go on another rampage. Those fears were soon proven sadly justified if greatly acted upon before anyting could happen since he was found with a large assortment of homemade ammunitions, illegally-obtained and homemade firearms and even a number of pipe bombs.

Williams was permanently sectioned - locked away in a mental institution by the order of the court under a clause of the Mental Health Act - due to being deemed a severe risk to the public. He died on Christmas Even 2014 in what is assumed to be a hallucination-induced nervous breakdown and resulting heart attack."

Your calmness might make them more upset if they mean for the silent treatment to stress you out, in which case you just have to keep holding onto your cool even if you want to clap back. So if they shoot back with something passive agressive just say as calmly as possible that you won't engage in an argument and you'll still wait until the time is right for a conversation.

Part of the conversation should also address the need for open and rational communication with the emphasis being on you guys having a happy relationship where you can both bring up grievances in a responsible way with one person saying how they feel without ganging up on each other, and without saying ""well you say I do this, but you do that..."""

She looked at me like ""what the hell are you doing"", and I told her to go ahead and cut my arm, because that would be less painful than how she cut me with her silence. It got her attention, and she started talking. 

Stonewalling (as it is referred to in relationship psychology) is the number 1 killer of relationships. There are two main reasons for it.

1, is that they don't know what to say, and they don't want to say the wrong thing. In that case, you can usually help the person figure out how to express what they are feeling by expressing non-judgmental curiosity. That is to say, ask questions about what they are feeling, starting with broad feelings (anger, hurt, jealousy, etc.), and narrowing it down. You must accept how they are feeling, even if you don't like how it makes you feel. Once they have figured out how to express themselves in a healthy manner, then you must figure out how to cope with that in a healthy manner. Figure out what the problem is, and what can be done to address the problem.

2, and more common, is that the person wants to punish you. That's a very unhealthy way to deal with relationship issues. My recommendation is to tell the person exactly as I said, that ""stonewalling is the number 1 killer of relationships"". Ask them if they want to continue the relationship, or if they are trying to end it. If yes, it's time to find a more healthy way of expressing their emotions. Help them do so. See #1 above. If they show no interest in communicating in a less unhealthy fashion, then it becomes incumbent upon you to decide whether or not you want to continue putting up with it. Is the pain they are inflicting on you worth keeping the relationship, knowing that it's not going to change? How long do you think you can continue while being treated like that? If the answer is not ""forever "", then it's best to end the relationship now, instead of wasting more time with them. 

Now with all of that, one of the most important things you must do is to make sure that you are communicating in a healthy manner. If you make your partner feel like they can't express themselves without suffering for it, stonewalling is the likely result. When your partner is upset at you, it's incumbent upon you to listen to the reasons they are upset, recognize that being upset is a valid emotion, and commit to working with them to solve the problem. If you belittle their experience, attempt to explain why they shouldn't feel the way they do (a person feels how they feel, regardless of the logic of it), refuse to work with them on the issue, try to ""win"" by getting angrier than they are, etc. etc. etc., you are contributing to the problem.  

Relationships are hard work. If you aren't both actively committed to constant maintenance, it will break down. One of the most powerful things I do for my wife's and my relationship is to tell her that I love her when I'm angry, hurt, or upset. I want her to know that regardless of how I'm feeling at that moment, I still love her, and that hasn't changed. It helps her accept the fact that my feelings are a passing thing, and that when I process them, we will still be there for each other. She tries her hardest by attempting to express herself when she's upset, and helping me to understand her feelings. We aren't perfect at it, but our relationship stays strong, because we both work to make it so."

I do not consider myself to have been abused as a child, but in the early-mid 90's the standards were different, and in my country (United Kingdom) it was still acceptable to smack a misbehaving child across their legs/bottom with a bare hand.

I got it a few times from both parents and once or twice grandparents - sometimes deserved (insofar as a 7 year old could 'earn' such a thing), but just as often probably not. It didn't make me behave any better, it just made me fear my parents, and taught me that they were prepared to impose violence upon me and that I couldn't stop them if they did.

This came to a head when I became a father, and out of sheer frustration I followed the example that I had growing up and smacked my daughter once across the leg. It didn't leave a mark and I deliberately considered how much force to use so as not to cause any harm - look at me even now, trying to justify it to myself as much as to you all - but the look on my daughter's face, of terror and betrayal and pain, scared me more than anything else I've ever experienced in my life.

It deeply wounded the relationship between myself and my parents. Seeing my daughter's face, I have never, ever, ever even thought of doing it again - even doing so now as I type this makes me cringe with shame - but I live with the knowledge that my parents saw the same expression on my face as a child, and it didn't stop them doing it again."

Yes his tail is twitching, but I think it's from excitement not aggravation. If he wanted to he could easily go under or through the barriers. He's showing off and loving it! 

If I had seen the height of the last tape before anything else, I'd have said no way a cat could jump over that--and I have a cat, who's an excellent jumper by the way. I still wouldn't have believed it. Cats are something else!"

1852,Baby and cat,9915,aww,12uzooh,https://v.redd.it/dajddswvvfva1,105,"LOL, my gran'boy spent so much time around my cat that he started to become one!

At 10 months, he toddled over to my cat, plopped down on his plump little behind and very gently patted her with one hand as he'd been taught. My parents were visiting and we all 'awwwwed'.

Then he leaned over and pressed his forehead to her side, as that's how cats said 'hi' to their friends. We all chuckled.

Then he leaned over further and licked her face, as that's how cats say I love you. We howled! The cat looked annoyed with us...she apparently felt that he was well mannered."

She had a daily routine of walking around to several nearby workshops and downloading data from a computer system at each separate office onto a3.5"" floppy (yes, this was back in the 90s).  Back at the desk, she would load the data from the floppies into a system on our computer.  It was some kind of tracking data that she sent somewhere (I don't remember all the details).  She had a whole routine of varying activities, and most of them involved waking around to other offices.  After she left and I took over, I followed her routine for about 3 days, then I asked the people in the offices if they knew what this data system was for; none of them did. I did some more research and asked more questions until I finally figured out it was an old system that they stopped using several years prior.  Nobody told her, so she kept on doing a job that would take her all day, even though it was completely unnecessary.  I started looking at everything else she was doing and absolutely zero of it was actual, necessary work.  She didn't care what she was doing, she just liked getting paid for walking around and talking to people all day.  That's literally all she did for three years.  Once I got rid of all her made up work, I figured out what the job was supposed to be and started doing that. I made Sailor of the Year at that command,  btw, and the job only took about 45 minutes each day to complete."

As I always say, there are three factors that go into your health

A fifteen year old Amish boy and his father were in a mall. They were amazed by almost everything they saw, but especially by two shiny, silver walls that could move apart and then slide back together again.


The boy asked, 'What is this Father?'


The father (never having seen an elevator) responded, 'Son, I have never seen anything like this in my life, I don't know what it is.'


While the boy and his father were watching with amazement, a fat old lady in a wheel chair moved up to the moving walls and pressed a button. The walls opened, and the lady rolled between them into a small room. The walls closed and the boy and his father watched the small numbers above the walls light up sequentially.


They continued to watch until it reached the last number …and then the numbers began to light in the reverse order.


Finally the walls opened up again and a gorgeous 24-year-old blond stepped out.


The father, not taking his eyes off the young woman, said quietly to his son.....


'Go get your Mother'"

Scherzer initially appealed the suspension but dropped his appeal hours later. In exchange, his fine was reduced from $10,000 to $5,000, according to a person familiar with negotiations between MLB and the players' union. The person spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the agreement hadn't been announced

Scherzer said shortly before New York's game at San Francisco that the Mets urged him to accept the suspension, adding that it was the best move for the team.

""I went through the appeal process. Looked at what that appeal process was going to look like. I thought I was going to get in front of a neutral arbitrator but I wasn't. It was going to be through MLB. Given that process I wasn't going to come out on top,"" Scherzer said. ""I'm going to follow what the Mets wanted me to do and that was to accept the suspension and come to a settlement."""

""No one can explain what is too sticky,"" Scherzer's agent, Scott Boras, said in a statement. ""There are no units of stickiness to quantify. How do you appropriately enforce? MLB attempts to level the playing field by using standards that are not measurable. Further one umpire has a stickiness standard that is different than all other umpires.""

""Under this standard, players are not given due process of how to use a approved substance provided by the league,"" Boras added. ""This reminds me of local wine taster - he likes what likes.""

That being said. This will hopefully be a good thing for the leafs and for bunting. I am not upset and I don’t think he didn’t deserve 3 games. Bunting honestly breaks my heart, I love his style but he is way too animated, and paints a target on his back for the refs not just the other team."

The frustration that Leafs fans feel though is the inconsistency of the whole DoPS.

Earlier in the season, Cernak actively threw an elbow into the face of Kyle Okposo of the Sabres; no penalty and a one game suspension. Last night, Tomas Nosek threw an elbow right to the chops of Eric Staal; no penalty and no further discussion of DoPS involvement.

While I understand there was not an injury on the plays, both of the incidents sure looked like the intention was to hit in the head. We really need to move away from the idea that as long as there wasn’t an injury head shots are okay."

They beat Spain on penalties after Spain had two perfectly legitimate goals ruled out. FIFA later contested Spain’s robbery complaints as “human error”.

They went on to beat Italy in arguably the most corrupt victory ever (excluding Barcelona & Man City’s blatantly overlooked ongoing corruption).

Brief rundown.

3 minutes - South Korean, Seol Ki-Hyeon fell over untouched in the penalty area. South Korea awarded a penalty. They missed it.

46 mins - Kim Tae-Young violently elbows Del Piero in the face in the penalty area. The referee simply waves play on.

88 mins - Totti is chopped down in the box. It’s a clear penalty. Italy can wrap this up. Justice will prevail. Oh wait no, Totti is inexplicably sent off for diving.

90 mins - Lee Chun-Soo kicks Maldini in the head. Referee waves play on.

110 mins - Tomassi beats the offside trap, rounds the keeper, goal. Sorry no, he’s called offside. In the officials’ defence it was tight but replays show he’s clearly onside. In 2002, the rule was to give benefit of the doubt to the striker. 

The Ecuadorean referee was later found guilty of unrelated match fixing errors in Ecuador. 

He was then later imprisoned for importing 6kg of heroin through JFK."

They campaigned for lower fences, which horse racing experts were against, and as a result, the number of deaths increased because horses will try ti jump over power fences faster than they can jump over higher fences. The danger comes from speed, not height.

The same goes for the whip. Horses can barely feel a whip, it never hurt them, but it did get their attention and focus. Animal rights campaigners thought this was bad so the new whips are essentially foam that wouldn't hurt a human, and the result is more horses falling because the jockey can't get their attention.

Boxing is a sport with similar ignorant interference too. People who wanted the sport banned demanded heavier gloves but the change from small gloves to big gloves adds more danger because it results in a prolonged beating. The only thing bigger gloves do is protect hands but they increase the likelihood of brain injury. This is why MMA has far fewer deaths than boxing. If heavyweights were using 8oz gloves, which is what welterweights currently use, the sport would be safer."

2722,"NBA Insider: Mavs ‘March Tank Plan’ Shut Down By Luka Doncic, Kyrie Irving",114,sports,12nmdi7,https://www.si.com/nba/mavericks/news/dallas-mavs-jason-kidd-luka-doncic-nico-harrison-mark-cuban-kyrie-irving-tanking,14,"i mean, didnt Luka only play for like 12 mins after saying that? doesn’t really help their case very much for all this to “come out” post hoc. i guess it does make luka and kyrie look better— theyre prob like “you better fall on the sword here and not make us look bad”. and im sure they genuinely did want to play— you can hardly get that skilled without being ultra-competitive.  but there’s absolutely no question that sitting was the best move, and $750k of cuban’s money is a complete trifle if that’s the only cost.

im so sick of the argument (by many smart people i love and respect, no less), that there’s somehow a difference when you say the quiet thing out loud— that the team is tanking— and thus that being outraged by this is justified. fuck that. you literally would rather have your intelligence insulted by people talking around the obvious fact that they’re tanking? what the fuck is that supposed to solve? it’s not a polite fiction if it is blatantly obvious that you are lying.

any argument that absolves the Blazers (e.g.), but not the Mavs, for intentionally losing for draft position cannot also simultaneously claim to be “anti-tanking” *in any way*. and this is completely self-evident. if it were so obvious that shit teams are gonna miss the playoffs and are destined for high picks anyway, why not just play their good players anyway? why are we ok with shutting everyone down on the Portlands and Utahs of the world weeks in advance, then? where’s the “competitive integrity” in that? that they are competing to lose? the answer is actually yes: we collectively appreciate that they understand the situation and compete in the proper arena (the losers arena lol). how is this different than expecting Dallas to run headlong into a terrible situation with no outs and virtually no chance of success? and don’t give me that “puncher’s chance” crap— the only reason that term *exists* is because the eponymous “puncher” has no chance of winning a drawn out fight… two play-ins, and then a 7 game set vs the one seed? with that shit team? cmon. anyone who thinks the Dallas FO feels any better about this situation than the fans do is completely delusional. but no, *they* are conniving losers, and the teams that have been tanking since game 35 are valiant winners who are just savvy in recognizing that they cannot win. how about we extend the benefit of the doubt that these people are _all_ hyper competitive to *everyone*, rather than merely the biggest losers? they are _all_ ultimately beholden to the same goal of achieving competitive success, and if they fail in achieving this, they are (usually xD) fired. or sometimes the NBA makes you take on a Colangelo or two. 

if you don’t like the situation, hate the *game*, not the player: it’s an incentives problem. change the way that pick protections work to make these situations more rare. actually smooth the odds to where the benefit of pulling a Dallas is so marginal that it’s not worth the upside of playing hard to the end. why is it that Dallas can throw like 2-3 games and go from a 20% chance of keeping their pick to like an 80% chance? maybe more teams would go for the playoffs anyway— damn the torpedoes— if there wasnt such a stark difference between missing the playoffs and being an 8 seed that gets obliterated in the first round. not even saying those are good suggestions, but if you don’t like the situation, *that* is the real problem, not an accidental moment of candor from a team’s coach / execs / owner.

ultimately, what everyone is looking for is for all teams to embody the spirit of competition. we are ok with shit teams tanking because we all know it is *more* competitive to lose today to win tomorrow in that situation, than to be the Washington fucking Wizards. ted leonsis is the fucking loser, not the blazers, not the jazz, and not cuban."

He didn't fracture his jaw. He's only having some teeth splinted and realigned because they shifted from the impact. If he had fractured his jaw, he would have needed to be wired shut for weeks and fed a liquid or very soft food diet thru a straw. The jaw fractures in at least 2 places and every tooth in the mouth aligns differently because the jaw will never quite line up the same way again after the injury. 

Having wired jaws shut before, it's a procedure I wouldn't wish on my worst enemies. You literally sew the upper teeth into the lower teeth one tooth at a time by threading the needle thru the gums in between every tooth. You pull the sutures very tight, like lacing up an old school pair of ski boots, and no amount of local anesthesia is enough to remove the discomfort because the patient is still able to sense what's going on."

I dont know exactly what happened with Gardner-Johnson, if they tried to low-ball him and he got offended and left

But losing him is going to really hurt, not only does he play multiple positions and legitimately can defend slot receivers

He's one of the elite players at his position and definitely the most underrated or maybe under appreciated might he be a better word - safety in the NFL

Whoever winds up taking his spot, it's a major downgrade. It's going to really hurt that secondary next season

Going into 2022, the Birds safeties were suspect. They got an early Christmas present and it sure everything up

Think this happening is going to be big next season. Hopefully it's not as big as the negative potential could be

3080,[homemade] Some Aussie meat pies to recreate the memories of my holiday down under,40,food,12w1uaq,https://i.redd.it/6hf0bcb73nva1.jpg,3,"I went to Sydney for a week-long holiday last month and fell in love with the meat pies I had there. 

I live in Malaysia and Singapore, and pies aren't exactly a thing here (except for those ""pies"" in McDonald's which are actually turnovers). There are pies from upscale establishments and cafes, but they're mostly chicken or Shepherd's Pies and are quite pricey. 

To make these pies, I relied on some recipes I found online and on Youtube and made some tweaks: 

- Beef: I used frozen ground beef because non-frozen ones are quite expensive here in Singapore. 

- Bacon bits: added them for more flavour and more filling

- HP sauce instead of worcestershire sauce because I happened to have one sitting in my cupboard 

- Stock: Cubed stocks are more common and less expensive here, so I went for cube stocks instead of liquid ones

- Pastry: I used puff pastry for both lid and base though most vids on Youtube suggested shortcrust pastry. Puff pastry is quite hard to find here, and shortcrust pastry is even harder to find. Managed to find some Australian-made puff pastry in an upscale supermarket. 

This was my first time trying pastry (I mostly prepare fried rice and noodles as they are our staple diet), and tbh, the puff pastry was harder to handle than I thought (I tore them a few times). 

Overall, these pies turned out quite okay, but were saltier than I expected). Now that I've learned this recipe, time to make more pies in the future."

That’s how my fave pies are built!

(Yes, an Aussie)"

3175,[Homemade] Oven-Baked Donuts,142,food,12vbm2h,https://i.redd.it/z3mt8h1gsgva1.jpg,7,"**Ingredients**

• 60g (1/4 cup) melted butter

• 50g (1/4 cup) canola oil

• 100g (1/2 cup) sugar

• 75g (1/3 cup) brown sugar

• 100g (2) eggs

• 5g (1 tsp) vanilla extract

• Baking powder (1 1/4 tsp)

• Baking soda (1/4 tsp)

• 5g (1 tsp) salt

• 270-300g (2 1/4 - 2 1/2 cups) flour

• 125g (1 cup) milk

• 15ml (1 tbsp) white vinegar

Coating

• 500g (4 cups) powdered sugar

• 120ml (½ cup) milk

• 1 pinch salt

**Instructions**:

Donut Dough:

1. To make buttermilk: Mix white vinegar into milk, stir, then let it rest for 5-10 minutes until it becomes thick and curdled
2. Whisk together melted butter, oil, sugar, and brown sugar until light and fluffy.
3. Add eggs one at a time, along with vanilla extract.
4. In a separate bowl, mix the smaller amount of flour with baking powder, baking soda, and salt.
5. Add the dry mixture to the butter mixture in three parts, alternating with the milk. Start and finish with the dry ingredients.
6. If the mixture is too runny, add a little more flour.

Baking:

1. Preheat the oven to 425°F (220°C) and grease a donut pan.
2. Pipe the batter into each donut mold, filling about 3/4 of the mold, leaving a little space at the top.
3. Bake for 10 minutes.
4. Allow the donuts to cool in the pan for a couple of minutes before transferring them to a cooling rack.
5. Let them cool down completely.

Glazing

1. In a large bowl, mix sugar, milk, and salt until smooth. To make the glaze thinner, add extra milk, just a teaspoon at a time.
2. Dip your donuts into the glaze and let them firm up.

> KHERSON OBLAST BY WIKIMAP.ORG. The Institute for the Study of War has stated that Ukrainian forces took up positions on the left bank of the Dnipro River in Kherson Oblast.

> More details: ISW has noted that on 20 and 22 April, Russian &quot;Military journalists&quot; claimed that Ukrainian forces had been holding positions on the eastern bank of Kherson Oblast for several weeks, had established stable supply lines to these positions and were regularly carrying out combat tasks, indicating that there was no Russian control over the area.

> Details: ISW has highlighted that it was the first time that it recognised the territory on the eastern bank of the Dnipro River in Kherson Oblast as controlled by Ukraine, as it had only just received reliable geolocation images of Ukrainian positions on the eastern bank, as well as Russian reports from various sources of a continued Ukrainian presence in the area.

This has nothing to do about dogs being peoples friends and 'you eat pigs, so why not dogs'? To foreigners, people assume this is the argument, byt it has nothing to do with this.

Dog meat is extremely unpopular here and is mainly eaten by old men. THEY BELIEVE THAT IF THE DOG IS BEATEN TO WITHIN AN INCH OF IT'S LIFE REPEATEDLY, FOR DAYS/WEEKS BEFORE IT DIES, IT RELEASES A CHEMICAL THAT IS GOOD FOR YOU (SEXUAL) 'STAMINA'.

That is why nobody eats it other than old countryside  right wing nutters. That is why people want to ban it, because the sellers literally torture the animals.

Edit: I understand that most animals we eat are tortured, but I mean these dogs have their legs bound by thin wire, hung upside down and beat with a stick untill they stop moving. Then they drop the dog the floor and do thesamethe next day, for many days in a row.The more the dog is beat, the more of this chemical is released. It's old school Asian medicine.

I have lived opposite a farm and the owner did this just in his yard. The sounds were horrible. I have also  spoken to people who eat this (it's a soup)."

> A Singaporean man is scheduled to be hanged next week for conspiring to smuggle a kilogram of cannabis, rights groups said, in the city-state&#039;s first execution in six months.

> &quot;If carried out, this execution would be in violation of international law and in stubborn defiance of continued outcry over Singapore&#039;s use of the death penalty,&quot; a spokesperson from Amnesty&#039;s regional office told AFP. In many parts of the world - including in neighbouring Thailand - cannabis has been decriminalised, with authorities abandoning prison sentences, and rights groups have been mounting pressure on Singapore to abolish capital punishment.

> The United Nations says that the death penalty has not proven to be an effective deterrent globally and is incompatible with international human rights law, which only permits capital punishment for the most serious crimes.

There are countless stories of poor and uneducated farmers being preyed upon by criminal organizations, who force them into assuming all of the risks that come with trafficking across SE Asia.

The big dealers and suppliers assume fewer risks when their mules are hanged and evidence destroyed. They get smarter, they go unpunished, and they continue to prey on those around them."

*THE DISCORD LEAKS | A classified Pentagon assessment portrays the threat to Europe, Asia and the United States as a growing security concern*  
  
Less than two years after President Biden withdrew U.S. personnel from Afghanistan, the country has become a significant coordination site for the Islamic State as the terrorist group plans attacks across Europe and Asia, and conducts “aspirational plotting” against the United States, according to a classified Pentagon assessment that portrays the threat as a growing security concern.  
  
The attack planning, detailed in U.S. intelligence findings leaked on the Discord messaging platform and obtained by The Washington Post, reveal specific efforts to target embassies, churches, business centers and the FIFA World Cup soccer tournament, which drew more than 2 million spectators last summer in Qatar. Pentagon officials were aware in December of nine such plots coordinated by ISIS leaders in Afghanistan, and the number rose to 15 by February, says the assessment, which has not been disclosed previously.  
  
“ISIS has been developing a cost-effective model for external operations that relies on resources from outside Afghanistan, operatives in target countries, and extensive facilitation networks,” says the assessment, which is labeled top-secret and bears the logos of several Defense Department organizations. “The model will likely enable ISIS to overcome obstacles — such as competent security services — and reduce some plot timelines, minimizing disruption opportunities.”  
  
The Afghanistan findings are one facet of a complex and evolving terrorist threat described in the leaked documents, now linked to a criminal case in which a member of the Massachusetts Air National Guard is accused of sharing classified information with friends online. Other reports in the same documents trove reveal persistent efforts by the Islamic State in other parts of the world to obtain expertise for creating chemical weapons and operating drone aircraft, and a plot in which the group’s supporters would kidnap Iraqi diplomats in Belgium or France in a bid to secure the release of 4,000 imprisoned militants.  
  
The documents will almost certainly be used as a political cudgel by congressional Republicans and others still seething about the Biden administration’s chaotic management of the U.S. exit from Afghanistan in August 2021.  
  
Hastily orchestrated, the evacuation enabled more than 120,000 people to flee the Taliban’s return to power. Tens of thousands of American allies were left behind, however, and the two-week operation saw horrific suffering. As the mission neared its end, an Islamic State suicide bomber killed an estimated 170 Afghans along with 13 American troops before U.S. drone operators, believing they had identified another would-be ISIS attacker, killed 10 civilians in a botched airstrike days later.

> A team of explorers announced it found a sunken Japanese ship that was transporting Allied prisoners of war when it was torpedoed off the coast of the Philippines in 1942, resulting in Australia&#039;s largest maritime wartime loss with a total of 1,080 lives.

> It took part in the mission together with Dutch deep-sea survey specialists Fugro and Australia&#039;s Defense Department.

> The ship was not marked as carrying POWs, and on July 1, 1942, the American submarine Sturgeon, after stalking the ship through the night, fired four torpedoes, which found their target, sinking the vessel in less than 10 minutes.

> The European Union&#039;s Foreign Policy Chief Josep Borrell called on the block&#039;s navies to patrol the Taiwan Strait in a show of commitment, in an opinion piece published in a French weekly on Sunday.

> &quot;It is not only for a moral reason that an action against Taiwan must necessarily be rejected. It is also because it would be, in economic terms, extremely serious for us, because Taiwan has a strategic role in the production of the most advanced semiconductors,&quot; he said.

1. That the government tell the truth about climate change

2. That the UK achieves carbon neutrality by 2025

3. That the government set up a citizens group to oversee 1 and 2.

https://extinctionrebellion.uk/the-truth/demands/

Lets look at these in turn.

1. Tell the truth. This is the UK government's stance on climate change: https://www.gov.uk/guidance/climate-change-explained. It's basically the scientific consensus. Extinction Rebellion think this is a lie. Which puts Extinction Rebellion at odds with scientists.

2. Yeah, we can't achieve carbon neutrality in 32 months without starving to death. Forget cars, tractors, ships, gas heating, and about a third of our electricity supply (assuming we keep our nuclear reactors, which Extinction Rebellion also oppose). So we'd starve and freeze to death.

3. I mean sure, but since demands 1 and 2 are impossible, it won't have anything to do.

So their demands are stupid. Well maybe their disruptive protests will be worth it because they raise awareness? Of what, i ask? Global warming? Please find me someone unaware of it."

April 22 (Reuters) - Climate change campaigners gathered outside Britain's parliament building ahead of Earth Day to urge action on global warming, while volunteers worldwide geared up to plant trees and clear trash to mark the 54th annual celebration of the environment.  
  
Earth Day this year, officially on Saturday, follows weeks of extreme weather with temperatures soaring to record highs in Thailand and a punishing heatwave in India, where at least 13 people died of heatstroke at a ceremony last weekend.  
  
Average global temperatures could hit all-time highs in 2023 or 2024, climate scientists have warned.  
  
Pope Francis, who has championed green causes since his election in 2013, urged people to look after the environment.  
  
""The Book of Genesis tells us that the Lord entrusted human beings with the responsibility of being stewards of creation (Gen 2:15). Care for the Earth, then, is a moral obligation for all men and women as children of God #EarthDay,"" he tweeted on Saturday.  
  
""Climate impacts are here,"" Areeba Hamid, co-executive director of Greenpeace UK, said on Friday as climate change activists walked down the street outside parliament in London, some dressed in green costumes and green paint.  
  
Hamid said when she now visits her hometown of Delhi, it feels like ""putting your head in the oven"" and that London's 2022 heatwave was like ""a dystopian film"".  
  
""We can't afford that anymore.""  
  
Activists led by the Extinction Rebellion group have gathered in London to kick off a four-day action, billed ""The Big One"", to coincide with Earth Day.  
  
About 30,000 people have signed up for family-friendly rallies and marches, marking a change in strategy for a group known for its disruptive tactics, including blocking roads, throwing paint and smashing windows.

CLEAN-UPS AND RITUALS

Globally, there was a flurry of activity in the run-up to Earth Day, with events being planned in Rome and Boston and major clean-up campaigns at Lake Dal in India's Srinagar and Florida's hurricane-hit Cape Coral.  
  
In Peru, shamans on Friday made an offering to the ""Pachamama"", or Mother Earth. Holding yellow flowers and rattles, the shamans walked around a papier-mache globe as they performed a cleansing ritual.  
  
The ancestral rituals - whose origins lie in the Indigenous cultures of Peru - are done to thank the Earth and build awareness of the planet, said Walter Alarcon, the president of the Healing Shamans of Peru International Organization.  
  
In San Francisco on Friday, dozens of demonstrators danced, marched and chanted in the streets as they called on California Governor Gavin Newsom to reduce the state's fossil fuel usage.  
  
Some carried banners reading ""No drilling where we're living"" and ""Newsom, divest California from fossil fuels.""  
  
Earlier in the week, U.S. President Joe Biden pledged to increase funding to help developing countries fight climate change and curb deforestation in Brazil's Amazon rainforest during a meeting with top world leaders.  
  
Governments have fallen far short of pledges in the 2015 Paris Agreement to limit heating of the climate by shifting off fossil fuels, amid crises including COVID-19, Russia's invasion of Ukraine, food shortages and strained ties between China and the U.S., the top two greenhouse gas emitters.  
  
A report by the U.N.'s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) says the planet is on track to warm beyond 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial times - a key threshold for even more damaging impacts - between 2030 and 2035.  
  
""There is a rapidly closing window of opportunity to secure a liveable and sustainable future for all,"" the IPCC has said. ""The choices and actions implemented in this decade will have impacts now and for thousands of years."""

> The Group of Seven farm ministers on Sunday condemned Russia for its war against Ukraine and the impact the conflict has had on global food security while also agreeing to help Kyiv revive its agriculture industry by sharing knowledge on demining farmland and rebuilding infrastructure.

> In a joint communique at the culmination of their two-day meeting in Miyazaki, southwestern Japan, the ministers also discussed pathways to overcoming climate change and the COVID-19 pandemic among the challenges faced by global food systems, saying an increase in efforts to make them more resilient and sustainable is urgently needed.

> &quot;We are deeply concerned about the devastating impact the war is having on food security globally, not least through price spikes in grains, fuel and fertilizers, which is disproportionately impacting the most vulnerable,&quot; the statement said.

In 2022, 708 cases of racial discrimination were reported across the country, 78 more than the previous year., according to an annual report compiled by counselling centres.__

As in the previous year, the cases of discrimination recorded by the members of the Network of Counseling Centers for Victims of Racism occurred most often in the workplace (133 cases) and in the education sector (116 cases), according to a report by the Federal Commission against Racism (FCR) and humanrights.ch, published on Sunday. Other areas heavily affected are local administration (96 cases), the neighborhood and district (82), as well as the private sector(67). This uptick in numbers reflects an increased willingness of the population to engage against racism, according to the report. 

The increase in the number of reports in education specifically can be explained by a greater awareness of the students concerned and their relatives, according to the report.. They also reflect the greater attention paid by the institutions to racist incidents and the fact that they report them more, says Gina Vega, head of the Network of Counseling Centers for Victims of Racism.

For example, one school principal approached a counseling center after seeing an increase in racist incidents. These included insults to young people with a migrant background, right-wing extremist symbols in the toilets and the word ""nigger"" carved on a door. In one class, a discussion about these incidents became heated after the teacher said the same word.

The most common grounds for discrimination were anti-Black racism (276 cases) and xenophobia (275 cases). Last year, a United Nations working group expressed concern ""about the prevalence of racial discrimination and the human rights situation of people of African descent in Switzerland”. This is most often manifested in the form of unequal treatment, insults or denigrating treatment.

Other forms of racism, however, are common and deserve an equally important place in the public debate, she adds. For example, there were 47 cases of anti-Arab racism, as well as 44 cases of anti-Muslim racism and 40 cases of hostility toward Asians. The cases assessed in the report represent the ""tip of the iceberg,"" its authors warn. Many racist incidents go unreported."

**30 June 1942:** Patrolling northwest of Bojeador as before. Dove at dawn, surfaced at dusk. At 2216 sighted a darkened ship to southward. At first, due to bearing on which sighted, believed him to be on northernly course, but after a few minutes observation it was evident he was on a westerly course, and going at high speed. He quite evidently had stood out of Babuyan Channel, headed for Hainan. Put on all engines and worked up to full power, proceeding westward in attempt to get ahead of him. For an hour and a half we couldn't make a nickel. This fellow was really going, making at least 17 knots, and probably a bit more, as he appeared to be zig-zagging. At this time it looked a bit hopeless, but determined to hang on in the hope he would slow or change course towards us. His range at this time was estimated at around 18,000 yards. Sure enough, about midnight he slowed to about 12 knots. After that it was okay. 

**1 July 1942:** Proceeding to intercept target as before. Altered course to gain position ahead of him, and dove at 0146. When he got in periscope range,  it could be seen that he was larger than first believed, also that his course was a little to the left of west, leaving us some 5,000 yards off the track. Was able to close some 1,000 yards of this, and then turned to fire stern tubes:

1. Only 3 tubes available forward, and at this range and with large target 4 fish spread desirable.

2. After tubes had 700 *[text smudged, possibly lbs?]* heads, while heads forward were small ones.

At 0225 fired four-torpedo spread, range 4,000 yards, from after tubes. At 0229 heard and observed explosion about 75-100 feet abaft of stack. At 0240 observed ship sink stern-first. 0250 surfaced, proceeded eastward, completing battery charge. Ship believed to be *Rio de Janeiro Maru*, or very similar type, although it is possible it was a larger ship; he was a big one. A few lights were observed on deck just after the explosion, but there was apparently no power available, and his bow was well up in the air in 6 minutes. Dove at dawn. No further contacts. 

Again the advantage of a straight shot was demonstrated. I can honestly say that, even at the long range at which these torpedoes were fired, every one felt perfectly conficent, at the instant of firing, that we would hit. In fact, immediately after firing, I turned with full rudder in order to bring the bow tubes to bear in case of a miss. The T.D.C. operator (Lt. Nimitz) remarked as the torpedoes were still running, ""We won't have to use any more. One of those will get him."" *[Lt. Nimitz had an unusual amount of confidence in 1942 American torpedoes]*

It was also noted (As it was also on 25 June) that at least some of the torpedoes that miss explode as they sink. Two were heard about six minutes after firing. It would seem that explosion occurs, however, before the torpedo reaches the bottom, as water was very deep. It may occur as the head crushes. Torpedoes were heard running by sound operator. Sketch of pursuit is included as enclosure (A2).

---

*Montevideo Maru* was what was known as a Hell Ship, Japanese ships used to transport POWs and slave laborers. As the name implies, conditions aboard these ships were hellish. Prisoners were packed so tightly into the ships' sweltering cargo holds that it was standing room only, had little access to food or water, and no sanitation to speak of. Delirium and death were very common."

> &quot;If carried out, this execution would be in violation of international law and in stubborn defiance of continued outcry over Singapore&#039;s use of the death penalty,&quot; an Amnesty spokesperson said.

> In many parts of the world - including in Thailand - cannabis has been decriminalized, with authorities abandoning prison sentences, and rights groups have been mounting pressure on Singapore to abolish capital punishment.

> The Group of Seven (G7) countries are considering a near-total ban on exports to Russia, Japan's Kyodo news agency reported last week, citing Japanese government sources. Russia has repeatedly threatened to scrap its participation in the grain deal, which is due to expire on May 18.

> ""This idea from the idiots at the G7 about a total ban of exports to our country by default is beautiful in that it implies a reciprocal ban on imports from our country, including categories of goods that are the most sensitive for the G7,"" Medvedev said in a post on his Telegram channel.

> ""In such a case, the grain deal - and many other things that they need - will end for them,"" he added.

> The G7 is reportedly discussing reversing its sanctions approach so that exports to Russia are automatically banned unless they are included on a designated list of products allowed to be shipped to the country. Under the current framework, goods are allowed to be sold to Russia unless they are explicitly black-listed.

> Medvedev, a long-time ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, is Putin's deputy chair at the influential Security Council and heads a government commission on arms production for the war in Ukraine.

> Moscow has repeatedly rallied against the terms of the Black Sea grain deal - the only significant diplomatic breakthrough of the 14-month conflict in Ukraine. It has said it will walk away from the initiative ahead of a May 18 deadline if the West does not lift restrictions on Russian agricultural and fertiliser exports.

>The G7 called on Sunday for the ""extension, full implementation and expansion"" of the deal to export Ukrainian grain through the Black Sea, the group's agriculture ministers said in a communique."

3827,"/r/WorldNews Live Thread: Russian Invasion of Ukraine Day 423, Part 1 (Thread #564)",1670,worldnews,12utzov,https://www.reddit.com/live/18hnzysb1elcs,608,"Last year an anonymous American bequeathed a million-dollar inheritance to Zaluzhny, who then donated it to the Armed Forces.  Ukrainians were very curious about this mysterious benefactor. [*Ukrainska Pravda* featured who he was, why was Zaluzhny his heir, why he cared about Ukraine, and did he donate to anyone else.](https://life-pravda-com-ua.translate.goog/society/2023/04/22/253945/?_x_tr_sl=auto&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en), as told by his best friend, his daughter, and the estate attorney. 



- Gregory Stepanets, who died in October, was born in Vinnytsia in 1938, the only child of a Ukrainian father and Jewish mother and lived there till 18.   He was close to his many cousins, who—due to occupation and later USSR resettlements—lived in Kazakhstan, Russia, and Ukraine.

- At 18, he moved to Moscow. He obtained several post-graduate degrees in Moscow, and throughout the 70s, worked in Moscow as a senior systems programmer, but was **later targeted by the KGB due to his support of dissidents, culminating in one job termination**. (He then worked with early IBM computers in Moscow, and would be sent abroad for training—he learned English, German, and Italian, in addition to his Ukrainian and Russian.)

- In mid 1980s, he was able to emigrate to Israel with his [Russian] wife and daughter, due to his heritage.  He could then emigrate to America but only as a single man—he then divorced, emigrated, Soviet collapsed, so then wife visited and remarried. His best friend—who he’d known since the 1960s in Moscow—also came to Seattle.

- He got a job at Microsoft in Seattle—always used public transportation, lived meager housing—his wealth/success was not observable—in fact, he held a patent, which he then sold to Microsoft.  This was only learned by his best friend after death. He worked there over 30 years, retiring at 81, due to cancer.

- He fought cancer for 3 years, but spent all his retirement creating his own absolutely enormous garden, so large that could hike, and his friends would get lost. He filled it with horticulture, cultivated it, it was his retirement passion.

- Then Russia invaded.  It’s implied that he wanted to go to his homeland, but by then, he was weak from cancer.  His daughter Milana says then became obsessed with listening to the news from the front, and did everything in his power to assure that Ukraine would win. His health failed, but then his wife started having heart problems. She died in October, he died next day.  

- He told his daughter how he wanted to leave his fortune.  All heirs were surprised. He left 1 million to the Israeli military, in honor of his Jewish mother.  

- He left one million to General Zaluzhny. 

> in conversations with his daughter, Gregory emphasized that ""Zaluzhny knows what to do with the inheritance.""

> > My father respected General Zaluzhny very much, admired him, considered him a great patriot of Ukraine, and the architect of the entire military campaign.

> > My father dreamed of a free, independent, economically strong, democratic and prosperous Ukraine,"" says Milana. 

Indeed, when he received it, [General Zaluzhny told the NYT,](https://www-pravda-com-ua.translate.goog/news/2023/01/24/7386365/?_x_tr_sl=auto&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en) ""I gave my whole life to the Armed Forces. And I had no doubts about what I should do with the inheritance. The last will of Mr. Gregory, apparently, was to support the Ukrainian army through me personally. I am grateful to everyone who helps the Armed Forces of Ukraine. And I am grateful to my family for their understanding.""

- Cultural education was also important to him. He bequeathed $2 million to the [Kyiv-Mohyla National University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_University_of_Kyiv-Mohyla_Academy), a research university, 
- and another 2 million to the Ukrainian Catholic University in Lviv [which was created in Soviet times and known as hallmark of Ukrainian language]


> > ""My father told me about the systematic suppression of the Ukrainian language by the Russian Empire and the Soviet Union. He said that in the 1950s there was only one Ukrainian-language [primary] school in Vinnytsia. He believed that education is extremely important for the future economic growth of Ukraine, so he wanted to support the development of culture and language, which, in his opinion, are the basis of national identity,"" adds Milana. 

- he also bequeathed undisclosed amounts to the members of the Kozatska Choir, who perform Ukrainian works from different eras: the Middle Ages, Renaissance, Baroque, Classicism and Romanticism. Milana says that her father really liked these songs. 

> > ""He greatly appreciated the contribution of Taras Kompanichenko and Khoreya Kozatska to the development of Ukrainian musical culture and listened to their songs every day,"" the daughter adds."

> Poland&#039;s broadcasting regulator has launched proceedings against the country&#039;s largest private TV network, American-owned TVN, following remarks on air by a leading Holocaust scholar, Barbara Engelking, in which she suggested that Poles did little to help Jews during the war.

> The scholar also claimed during the interview that Poles today often &quot;Falsify history&quot; by exaggerating the extent to which during the war Poles provided help to Jews.

> The current national-conservative ruling camp has been on the other side of that debate, promoting a narrative of the war that highlights the many Poles who helped Jews during the Holocaust and emphasises that Poles themselves were also among the Nazis&#039; primary victims.

A Taiwanese publisher who published many books banned in China is believed detained in Shanghai, according to a leading Chinese literary figure, sparking comparisons with the cross-border detentions and kidnappings of five Hong Kong booksellers in 2015.

Li Yanhe, known by his pen-name Fucha, or Fuchsia, was detained after traveling to visit relatives in China, writer Bei Ling told Radio Free Asia on Thursday.

""I heard it through literary circles in Shanghai,"" Bei said. ""We know that he has been detained, but not where he is.""

Bei said Li had come to mainland China to visit relatives and tend to the graves of his ancestors, a reference to the grave-sweeping festival of Qing Ming on April 5.

Bei initially reported Li's detention via Facebook, but later took the post down at the request of Li's relatives. He said an earlier attempt to secure his release during the recent visit of former Taiwanese President Ma Ying-jeou hadn't been successful.

He called on the Taiwanese government, as well as high-profile figures in the media and publishing world to speak out on Li's behalf.

Many people are likening Li’s disappearance to the cross-border detention and kidnapping of five Hong Kong publishers from the Causeway Bay Bookstore in 2015, including Lam Wing-kei, who later sought refuge in Taiwan from an ongoing crackdown on dissent in Hong Kong.

‘Safe and well’

The Taiwanese government agency charged with managing relations with Beijing said Li was ""safe and well,"" but declined to comment further.

Mainland Affairs Council spokesman Jan Jyh-horng said the government is paying attention to developments in the case, and offering ""care and assistance"" to his family members, the island's Central News Agency reported from a regular news briefing.

""We have to respect the family's wishes, so we are unable to offer further explanations at this time,"" Jan told reporters. ""That's all I can tell you.""

Taiwan's semi-official Straits Exchange Foundation said it would always ""give priority to the personal safety of the parties concerned, and respect the wishes of the family members.""

""We will continue to pay attention to the development of the case and provide necessary assistance,"" said the foundation, which has previously functioned as an unofficial go-between in closed-door negotiations with Beijing.

Li, who is ethnically Manchu, founded the Eight Banners imprint under Taiwan's Book Republic publishing group in 2009, using it to publish non-fiction works on China's overseas infiltration and influence operations, the 1989 Tiananmen massacre, and other work critical of Beijing.

The Taiwan-based Hong Kong news site Photon News said recent titles offering independent views of Tibetan and Mongolian history could also have sparked Beijing's ire, a view shared by Book Republic's founder and president Kuo Chung-hsing.

""I can only guess that it has something to do with the fact that the views in the books he published were different from the official Chinese view of history,"" Kuo told Radio Free Asia. ""Maybe he is now being investigated [for that].""

Incommunicado

Kuo said Li had gone incommunicado three or four days after arriving in Shanghai in mid-March, where he had intended to tend to family graves and visit his sick mother.

""[Li] Yanhe is still a Chinese national, so the officials here [in Taiwan] may not be able to do anything,"" he said.

""There is a danger, and your security can't be guaranteed,"" Causeway Bay bookseller Lam Wing-kei says. ""[China’s] national security law applies anywhere in the world, and the entire universe."" Credit: RFA file photo
Former Causeway Bay bookseller Lam Wing-kei agreed.

""The way they see it, if you were born in mainland China, you are from there,"" he said. ""Back when the Causeway Bay people were detained, they treated two of my colleagues who were born in mainland China a bit differently from myself and Lee Bo, who were born in Hong Kong.""

""The difference was that they didn't allow [them] to return to Hong Kong, whereas they did allow me and Lee Bo to go back to Hong Kong,"" Lam said.

Lam said the incident should remind publishers in Taiwan to reconsider planned visits to China.

""There is a danger, and your security can't be guaranteed,"" he warned. ""Their national security law applies anywhere in the world, and the entire universe.""

Eight Banners Press declined to comment when contacted by Radio Free Asia on Thursday, saying they hadn't managed to verify the news of Li's detention independently.

‘Unprecedented bad news’

Germany-based writer Liao Yiwu said via his Facebook account that if Bei Ling's account is accurate, then ""it is unprecedented bad news for Taiwan's cultural sector.""

""It is as bad as another 'kidnapping case in Causeway Bay,’"" he wrote in a reference to the detention of the five Hong Kong booksellers. ""Taiwan's political, cultural and journalistic circles, regardless of their political stance, should not remain shamefully silent. Otherwise, the whole free world will look down on them,"" Liao wrote.

Li was born in the northeastern Chinese province of Liaoning to a Manchu family, and joined the Chinese Communist Party after graduating from university, before rising to become vice president of the Shanghai Literature & Art Publishing House.

He married a Taiwanese woman in 1996, and settled in Taiwan in 2009. His last Facebook post was made on March 12.

In another recent case, Chinese authorities arrested Chen Zhiming, the editor of a Hong Kong-based political magazine who went missing in September 2022, on suspicion of “running an illegal business,” Radio Free Asia reported in January.

The former editor at the People's Daily Press who moved to Hong Kong to set up the Exclusive Characters political magazine specializing in in-depth interviews with influential people, stopped updating his social media accounts from around Sept. 21, 2022.

  Let us realize that we are not mere individuals, but interconnected beings, inextricably linked to the cosmos and all of creation.

 We are the product of the universe, as well as its architects, and with each breath we take, we have the power to manifest our reality. 

Let us embrace the wisdom of ancient civilizations and the mysteries of the universe, for they hold the key to unlocking our true potential.

 May we remember that love is the fundamental force that binds us all together, and that through love, we can transcend the limitations of time and space.

 Let us embrace our divinity and awaken to the infinite possibilities that exist within and around us. For we are not just physical beings, but spiritual beings having a human experience, on a journey of self-discovery and soul evolution.

 Let us walk this path with grace, humility, and reverence for the miracle of existence, and may we create a world of harmony, beauty, and love, for ourselves and all beings."

Nonetheless, at least it is made with ""durum semolina/wheat"" and not normal wheat. If it was normal wheat it would have been even worse than being broken in half.

That's not even important, break it or not, many Italians don't even care. They care more about the ingredients."

On February 24th, I lost my old store, and PayPal took all of my money. Soon after, I had to flee and abandon my workshop. Outside of my country, I am being treated badly because of my Russian passport. It feels like when other nations see me, they forget about their recent wrongdoings. Iraq, Libya, Vietnam. You did not consent to these atrocities, do you think I did? I lost everything. Everything that could be lost. And I wanted to lose myself too. Religion held me back. I hoped to get lost in thoughts while crossing the road and die at the intersection. But time heals. I found new friends. Guys from Russia, Ukraine, Georgia. We opened a new store. We work together. We search for housing together when yet another landlord kicks us out. But now I don't feel alone. And in a week, I am getting married. A wedding with six guests, a rented jacket, and the best bride in the world. Thank you, Reddit. I received messages of support in my inbox for a whole year. Often multiple times from the same people. Thank you. Before, I thought it was vulgar, this throwing of words of support to strangers by other strangers. Until I found myself in such a situation.

thank you guys
