Firstly, I lived in the Muldoon area, which is mentioned in the article (just off the highway down Turpin).  I'm not sure if my condo was within the questioned boundaries, but in general the Muldoon area was lower-ish income and racially diverse.  I did vote once while I lived there, and it was not easy; I had to cross the highway on one of the nation's ""Double Diamond"" bridges.  It's not exactly friendly for walking and, at any rate, elections happen in November and April when there's almost certainly a layer of ice on the ground, so you had to drive.  If you had no car, you had to find another way to get there.  (NOTE: Anchorage mails ballots now and has since...2018?  So this problem has largely been solved.)

Eagle River (and a few smaller communities like Chugiak and Peters Creek) starts about 5-10 miles north of Anchorage.  It is largely a bedroom community for Anchorage, although as its population grows it is gaining its own identity.  Income is middle/upper-middle, and the demographics skew significantly more white than Muldoon.  Eagle River is legally part of the Municipality of Anchorage, and there have been talks of it breaking off to be its own city-borough; I do not know how serious these talks are, but I hadn't seen it get much real headway.

The proposed map, which was nixed by the court, wanted to split Eagle River in half.  Half would vote with Muldoon, and the other half would vote with the Valley.  (The Valley has similar demographics to Eagle River.)  The interim map preserved Eagle River as one district.

One thing to consider is, Alaska is very large and, aside from a few tiny islands, very sparsely populated.  There will be districts that kind of jump around, because everyone has to be in some kind of district.  You may get a few villages lumped in with the edge of Fairbanks, for example, or some odd jumbles of islands in the Southeast all together.

Eagle River does have its own identity, and it has the requisite population to be one complete Senate district.  There's good folks out there, and they are proud of their home.  They do not identify with Muldoon and, largely, do not identify with the Valley: they are Eagle River.  I believe the court made both the correct and right decision by keeping the city together.  And I believe that the people trying to pull one over on Alaskans by splitting it apart to gain seats in the legislature forgot that this is the state that, by direct ballot initiative, voted for marijuana legalization, ranked-choice voting, and keeps voting up stronger unions.  It may be a red state, but Alaska will surprise you."

> Text messages exchanged between members of former President Donald Trump&#039;s 2020 presidential campaign team could give prosecutors &quot;Stronger evidence&quot; of an alleged crime in Georgia, said former prosecutor Michael Zeldin.

> Trump has maintained his innocence in the Georgia case and has accused prosecutors who have investigated his conduct surrounding the 2020 election, which he has repeatedly claimed was rigged despite substantial evidence, of conducting witch hunts aimed at weakening his stance in the 2024 presidential race.

> &quot;My phone call to the Secretary of State of Georgia, and a second call which the Marxists, Communists, Racists, and RINOS don&#039;t even want to talk about, were &#039;PERFECT&#039; calls,&quot; Trump posted on Truth Social in January.

The GOP is traditionally in favor of fiscal responsibility, especially if said fiscal responsibility benefits large corporations or institutions - well, what's more fiscally responsible than limiting severe injuries that would be handled by insurance companies or by hospitals when the injured party is uninsured? Elected law enforcement officials across the country are generally in favor of gun control, regardless of their political affiliation.

&#x200B;

* 8 times more likely to commit suicide
* Nearly 6 times more likely to experience depression
* More than 3 times more likely to use illegal drugs
* More than 3 times as likely to be high risk for HIV or AIDS.

&#x200B;

All major medical associations, from the AMA, the American Academy of Pediatrics, and the American Psychological Association stand against conversion therapy.

&#x200B;

According to The Trevor Project’s 2020 National Survey on LGBTQ Youth Mental Health, 10% of LGBTQ youth reported undergoing conversion therapy, with 78% reporting it occurred when they were under age 18.

&#x200B;

***Youth who reported undergoing conversion therapy reported more than twice the rate of attempting suicide in the past year compared to those who did not.***

&#x200B;

***Furthermore, a peer-reviewed study published by The Trevor Project in the American Journal of Public Health found that LGBTQ youth who underwent conversion therapy were more than twice as likely to report having attempted suicide and more than 2.5 times as likely to report multiple suicide attempts in the past year.***

&#x200B;

* ***Rates of attempted suicide by LGBT young people whose parents tried to change their sexual orientation were more than double (48%) the rate of LGBT young adults who reported no conversion experiences (22%).***
* ***Suicide attempts nearly tripled for LGBT young people who reported both home-based and out-of-home efforts to change their sexual orientation (63%).***
* ***High levels of depression more than doubled (33%) for LGBT young people whose parents tried to change their sexual orientation compared with those who reported no conversion experiences (16%) and more than tripled (52%) for LGBT young people who reported both home-based and out-of-home efforts to change their sexual orientation.***
* ***Sexual orientation change experiences during adolescence by both parents/caregivers and externally by therapists and religious leaders were associated with lower young adult socioeconomic status, less educational attainment, and lower weekly income.***

&#x200B;

>A federal judge donated tens of thousands of dollars to New Orleans’ Roman Catholic archdiocese and consistently ruled in favor of the church amid a contentious bankruptcy involving nearly 500 clergy sex abuse victims, an Associated Press investigation has found, but the judge won’t step down from the case.

.....

>Guidry indicated he would seek guidance from the federal judiciary’s committee on codes of conduct. And in a separate hearing called on Friday, he told attorneys in the case that the committee had approved his continuing to handle appeals related to the bankruptcy.

>The reporting by Jim Mustian of the AP on Guidry is only one example of how many links are shared by the New Orleans area’s legal establishment and the local archdiocese, which serves a region with a half-million Catholics and is the oldest to declare bankruptcy amid the clergy sex abuse crisis.

....

>Meanwhile, attorneys representing abuse victims in the bankruptcy are seeking to unseal thousands of secret church documents produced as evidence in lawsuits and in an ongoing federal law enforcement investigation of clergy abuse in New Orleans going back decades. Agents involved in that investigation last year spoke with a retired Catholic priest from New Orleans named Lawrence Hecker who has been publicly accused of molesting “countless” children, but he has not been charged with any crimes.

....

>Most of that giving, $36,000 of it, came in the months after the archdiocese sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection amid a crush of sexual abuse lawsuits. That included a $12,000 donation to the archdiocese’s Catholic Community Foundation in September 2020 on the same day as a series of filings in the bankruptcy, and a $14,000 donation to the same charity in July of the following year.

listen to SCOTUS hearing Catholic Services vs. Philadelphia…

This is a Federalist Society case created to push legalizing religious discrimination even if it violates contractual obligations to service the public inwhich Catholic Services refused to find homes for kids in DHS custody if the homes were found entirely suitable and individuals were found suitable Catholic Services would reject that home if the parent was gay… despite choosing to take a contract with Philadelphia that required sexual orientation not to factor into the decision.

Alito at one point after the defense states clearly that Catholic Services knew in no uncertain terms what responsibility DHS required be fulfilled and this vacating of responsibility would set a precedent of anyone who took public funds to refuse to satisfy contractual obligations without recourse (which it does) Alito freaked…

He basically accused the lawyers for philadelphia DHS of using this case as a way of punishment for anyone who doesn’t agree with their agenda to push homosexuality…

It was insane, especially since he knew it was a Federalist case and he knew the intent of the case was to do exactly what the lawyer pointed out; Allow religious discrimination to exempt conservative institutions from fulfilling contractual obligations.


It’s even crazier because Catholic Services was suing to have the right to a contract with the city that was not renewed even though it indicated it would not discharge its contractual duties…

So, it wasn’t even trying to get Catholic Services to do anything, Philadelphia just said, “if you won’t do the job we need done, you can’t have the contract..”

SCOTUS found in favor of Catholic Services against all reason which forces the city of Philadelphia to use a Private Religious organization who has openly said it will not discharge the duties the City needs done…

Absolutely insane… no credibility"

A Supreme Court ruling on Friday ensured the abortion pill mifepristone can still be purchased and used in the US, freezing a lower court ruling that would've effectively banned access to the pill.

Two justices, Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, publicly dissented, with the latter writing an opinion in which he called out three female justices by name — including fellow conservative justice Amy Coney Barrett — in an apparent act of judiciary ""theater,"" Scott Lemieux, a professor of political science at the University of Washington and an expert on the Supreme Court and constitutional law, told Insider.

The case came to the court after a judge in Texas ruled to suspend the Food and Drug Administration's more-than-20-year-old approval of mifepristone. The Biden administration asked the Supreme Court to grant an emergency request that would protect the FDA approval while the case is still being litigated.

Because it was an emergency request, the case was reviewed under what is known as the court's ""shadow docket,"" where they rule on procedural matters. Cases that are considered on the shadow docket do not get the same level of review as other cases, meaning ""the decisions are accompanied by little to no explanation and often lack clarity on which justices are in the majority or minority,"" according to the Brennan Center for Justice.

Indeed, while the Court said they were granting the Biden administration's request, no explanation was provided by the majority as to why. The ruling did not specify how most of the justices voted, or even how many justices voted in favor. Both Thomas and Alito elected to note their dissents, with only one of them explaining why."

In 1875, minority speaker James Blaine proposed an amendment to the US Constitution. The so-called Blaine Amendment proposed text was:

>No State shall make any law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; and no money raised by taxation in any State for the support of public schools, or derived from any public fund therefor, nor any public lands devoted thereto, shall ever be under the control of any religious sect; nor shall any money so raised or lands so devoted be divided between religious sects or denominations.

It failed in the Senate and was never passed federally, however some 35-odd states pushed through amendments mirroring the sentiment to their own state constitutions.

One of those states is Texas.

Article 1, Section 7 of the Texas state constitution reads:

>APPROPRIATIONS FOR SECTARIAN PURPOSES.  No money shall be appropriated, or drawn from the Treasury for the benefit of any sect, or religious society, theological or religious seminary; nor shall property belonging to the State be appropriated for any such purposes.



In 2015, Montana passed a version of the tax credit voucher system to fund scholarship programs for low income students to attend private schools. Abiding by their own Blaine Amendment in their state constitution, this program had a “no-aid” provision that specifically excluded parochial schools from participating. 

A group of parents, backed by libertarian group Institute for Justice, sued, alleging that the program discrimination against parochial schools violated the Establishment clause of the US Constitution and asked that the court open the program to parochial schools as redress. The case, *Espinoza v Montana Department of Revenue*, proceeded to the Montana Supreme Court, who ruled that the program itself was unconstitutional according to their state Blaine Amendment as the program could not prevent public dollars from going to private schools under the current program design. They ordered the program to stop entirely.

The plaintiffs appealed to the Supreme Court and in 2020, the conservative-led USSC released a narrow decision that the “no-aid” provision in their voucher program was unconstitutional as it violated the Free Exercise clause- with Roberts writing the majority opinion. The program’s prohibition against parochial school participation was the focus, with Roberts writing it violated the US constitution as it “bars religious schools from public benefits solely because of the religious character of the schools"" and ""also bars parents who wish to send their children to a religious school from those same benefits, again solely because of the religious character of the school."" 

Roberts also asserted that the Montana Supreme Court was wrong to invalidate the entire program on the basis of the no-aid provision in the state constitution. Roberts wrote that ""A state need not subsidize private education. But once a state decides to do so, it cannot disqualify some private schools solely because they are religious.""

**Only Alito touched on the constitutionality of the Blaine Amendment that the Montana “no-aid” provision was based on in his concurrent opinion, stating that the Montana State Constitutional Blaine amendment might violate the US constitution Free Exercise clause.** The ruling kneecapped the Blaine Amendment in Montana but didn’t outright rule it out and left Blaine Amendments largely untouched in the other 35-odd states that still have them.

Because the decision in *Espinoza* was such a narrow decision that it didnt directly comment on the constitutionality of Blaine Amendments, they’re still in effect for the states that have them. Paxton (and others) now see blood in the water. Of course AG Paxton has similarly alleged that Blaine Amendments violate the US constitution, echoing the position of his masters- The Federalist Society.

**These proposed  laws are designed to defy the Blaine Amendment in our state constitution in hopes they will be challenged in court.** They would likely prevail in Texas’s own conservative state courts but the anticipation is that the plaintiffs would appeal all the way up to a very conservative-friendly Supreme Court. *Espinoza* was ruled 5-4, with Ginsburg writing the dissent.  Not only would the ruling likely be 6-3, the hope is that the justices might rule all state Blaine Amendments as unconstitutional, succeeding where *Espinoza* didn’t and paving the way for vouchers to benefit parochial schools throughout the nation. 

In short, passing these laws is just a stepping stone to further the goals of the GOP/Federalist Society/Christian Nationalists to steer public dollars to parochial institutions, thereby choking the life out of public schools by diverting their dollars and instituting their view of a nation based on their Christian faith.

These laws cannot pass because it’s not just Texas’s future on the line."

Obscenity is not protected by the First Amendment, and the Supreme Court developed a three-pronged obscenity test to evaluate state laws in [*Miller v. California*, 413 U.S. 15 (1973)](https://caselaw.findlaw.com/court/us-supreme-court/413/15.html):

To be considered obscene, all of the following criteria must be met:

1. Whether the average person, applying contemporary community standards would find that the work, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest

2. Whether the work depicts or describes, in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct specifically defined by the applicable state law

3. Whether the work, taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value."

As a progressive, it is difficult for me to be stimulated mentally by fear.  But that is what conservatives are.  They are afraid of the following :

1.) People of color, especially blacks and recently Asians.

2.) Immigrants, especially those who are fleeing from Central American countries.

3.) LGBT due to concerns of ""grooming"" children 

4.) Public schools due to indoctrination of liberal beliefs and version of history

5.) People who worship a different religion than Christianity (Muslim, Hindu, etc.)

6.) Anyone in the medical and science fields of experts (why they are anti-vax, climate change deniers)

7.) Worker unions, because of ""socialism""

8.) Fair elections, due to the chance that they might lose

383,Rape lawsuit trial puts spotlight back on Trump and women,828,politics,12vh5fa,https://apnews.com/article/trump-carroll-columnist-rape-lawsuit-trial-d42b3034c049cecd10718746ca87e1e4,30,"> “I’m filing this lawsuit not just for myself but for every woman in America who has been grabbed, groped, harassed, sexually assaulted and has spoken up and still has been disgraced, shamed or fired,” Carroll said early on.

By their own admission, [roughly 6% of unincarcerated American men are rapists](https://willamette.edu/about/leadership/president/pwgsah/pdf/lisak-undetected-rapists.pdf). And the authors acknowledge that their methods will have led to an *underestimate*. Higher estimates are closer to [14%](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.685.7650&rep=rep1&type=pdf). 

That comes out to somewhere between 1 in 17 and 1 in 7 unincarcerated men in America being rapists, with a cluster of studies showing about 1 in 8. 

The numbers can't really be explained away by small sizes, as sample sizes can be quite large, and statistical tests of proportionality show even the best case scenario, looking at the study that the authors acknowledge is an underestimate, the 99% confidence interval shows it's at least as bad as 1 in 20, which is nowhere near where most people think it is. People will go through all kinds of mental gymnastics to convince themselves it's not that bad, or it's not that bad *anymore* (in fact, [it's arguably getting worse](https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/cdc-sexual-attacks-teen-girls-increased-lockdown-rcna70782)). But the reality is, most of us know a rapist, we just don't always know who they are (and sometimes, [they don't even know](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquaintance_rape#Motivations), because [they're experts at rationalizing their own behavior](https://web.archive.org/web/20191102225207/https://sapac.umich.edu/article/196)). 

[Rape is one of the most severe of all traumas, causing multiple, long-term negative outcomes](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/38d2/cc8df92f64acb9141d6d8ef0d79d0ce2fe15.pdf). 

We need to do a better job of learning how to identify the signs and [holding offenders accountable](https://www.reddit.com/r/stoprape/comments/12diz7v/rape_is_a_tractable_problem_and_we_can_all_do_our/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).

And they have good reason to fear the cult. Not just for their own safety, but because Republicans are struggling to win elections *with* MAGA support. There's no way they can win them without it. So no one is going to campaign in a way that would piss off the cult, and insulting Dear Leader would absolutely do that.

Don't get me wrong: disavowing Trump is the right thing to do. But the consequence of doing it in a Republican primary would be having the voter enthusiasm a ""please clap"" Jeb Bush style campaign. That's why they won't do it. They care more about desperately clinging onto power than doing the right thing."

Nearly all live-in aides enjoy their roles, and see them as more fulfilling than habit to cover two or three patients a day with challenging transportation issues and often less than full time hours available. In addition, while these individuals used to be underpaid, compensation is now three times as high as twenty years ago. So real progress has been made.

Moreover there is a shortage of labor tied to covid, and to replace a live-in aide with three 8-hour shifts is would be far more expensive for the state than having the patient cared for in a nursing home. Multiply that by fifty thousand people, the question becomes should we bankrupt our state and improve nothing?"

> The Supreme Court ruled Friday evening that it would stay a decision from Texas District Court Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk attempting to reverse the FDA&#039;s approval of the abortion drug mifepristone.

> One guy is claiming dictatorial authority over American prescription drug policy by exploiting a quirk in the anachronistic court system.

> Probably the only way Republicans could get a national abortion ban is through legal rule-by-decree, by following Kacsmaryk&#039;s lead. A small but growing number of Democrats are facing up to the fact that confronting these lawless right-wing forces in the courts will require equally radical moves in response-including ignoring court decisions outright if they are sufficiently egregious.

I never thought I’d have to fight it right here in the United States of America.”

>Rexrode was speaking specifically of those who used a new Florida law to have 92 books banned from the county’s public school classrooms and libraries. Books by Jodi Picoult and Toni Morrison were removed following an objection filed by a member of Moms for Liberty who had not even read them.

>“I urge you to think about what a book ban means and use transparency,” Rexroad told the board on Tuesday.

>As the father of a 14-year-old in middle school, he added, “I don’t need anyone else telling my son what he can and cannot read. I’m perfectly capable of doing that myself.”

>“I grew up in rural South Carolina, and books got me out of the trailer parks,” Rexrode said. “My parents trusted those educators and the librarians to let me read what I needed to read.”"

From reporter Carter Sherman: A common, effective, and safe abortion pill can remain on the market for now, the Supreme Court ruled Friday night, in the first major Supreme Court ruling on abortion since the justices overturned Roe v. Wade last year. 

Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, two of the most hardline right-wingers on the overwhelmingly conservative-leaning court, publicly dissented from the court order.

Over the last few weeks, the drug mifepristone, one of the two drugs typically used to induce medication abortions in the United States, has taken center stage in the country’s relentless abortion wars. Although the vast majority of research has found that mifepristone is safe, anti-abortion activists have asked federal courts to suspend the Food and Drug Administration’s 2000 approval of the drug.

The Biden administration asked the Supreme Court to suspend any court orders that would change mifepristone’s availability, and the justices agreed. Instead, mifepristone will remain on the market, without restrictions, while the case winds its way through the courts.

>*In recent speeches reviewed by HuffPost, Haley mostly sticks to touting stricter voter ID laws and the economic development she oversaw as governor that made South Carolina what she calls “the beast of the Southeast.” When she gets into race issues, it’s to argue the country isn’t racist because voters elected her as the first woman of color to lead South Carolina.*

>*That Haley’s decision on the flag boosted her profile within her own party then speaks to how much the GOP later changed under Trump. Whereas in 2015, Haley was celebrated for working with Democrats and demonstrating a moderate backbone, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis is currently second behind Trump in a hypothetical primary matchup because he steamrolled opponents to make Florida the epicenter of the nation’s culture wars. Haley, meanwhile, is polling in* [*single digits*](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/latest_polls/2024/) *very early in the race, and is* [*tied with DeSantis in South Carolina*](https://www.winthrop.edu/winthroppoll/2023-april-winthroppoll-results.aspx)*.*

>“I believe there are absolute truths. The sky is blue. You can’t tell me that it’s any other color but blue,” *said Brannon, who does not intend to back Haley in the presidential primary.* “There was a time when Nikki stood up and said ‘never Trump’ and then became one of his biggest supporters. In my opinion ... Nikki might tell you the sky is not blue.”"

You don't normally see this level of truth on this topic. More common is the ""your gun doesn't mean anything against an F-16"" trope. As we're recently learning with the test attacks on power grids and telecom companies, there ARE people out there gathering data and sketching plans. They have lots of guns and even more ideas and know better than to believe they'll ever face off against a tank.

>Several discomfiting questions arise: How many right-of-center Americans believe violence will be necessary to repel a perceived racial or cultural threat? Do those who harbor that belief have genuine intent to take up arms? If so, what it would take to make them shoot?

I think the counter-argument to this is even more discomfiting.

Oh the right wing media will whip them up and yeah, there will be violence because these shitheads can't contribute anything to society BUT violence but it doesn't turn into anything more.  They are just not smart enough to pull it off and the first time one of their little clubs gains legs it doesn't last long and serves as an example for the rest of them.

Did you watch the governance of the ""DC Trucker Convoy?""  I did.  The only twitter thread I ever followed in real time was on it by Zachary Petrizzo.  Like Jordan Klepper, Petrizzo can actually stand to be around these shitheads long enough to talk to and understand them without laughing in their greasy unwashed slack jawed faces at their lunacy and idiocy.

To be a right wing zealot on the edge of militancy, you first have to not give a shit about your family so you can take several months off of useful employment to go camp at the Hagerstown speedway on a whim.  Listening to interviews with them, you come to immediately understand there was a reason so many 1/6 protestors were turned in by their own families -- they're unlikable people who are on the edge of domestic violence every single day and so if they ""went away"" the people they ""love"" would sadly acknowledge that it only made the world a better place.

They also cannot organize in a robust way.  They simply cannot interact with ANYONE without it being a dick measuring contest with a winner and a loser.  Wolf pack rules.  The leader can ONLY be the leader through dominating the rest of the lone wolves and that is a fragile leadership model in any attrition-based combat environment.  Without that leader, they are ALWAYS in it for numero uno only and would screw each other for a half-eaten Big Mac.  That hinders cooperation and actually following some kind of organized strategy.  It also means their morale is incredibly fragile.

Think that isn't right?  Here is a link to their own little mini ""Fall of the Fourth Reich"" story:

Those choads were fighting with each other more than they were fighting the people jeering them from the sidewalks.  That will never change.  You think YOU hate them?  They hate each other worse and for most of the same reasons.  In some civil breakdown, half of them die by the other half's hands because they can't decide which Applebee's to liberate first.

If they came after the rest of us like they like bragging about, we organize like civilized people do and we fight for what we believe in.   The first time they hit real opposition, like the egg throwers in Berkeley, they wouldn't be able to coordinate a response and half of them would hold their leader responsible and try to go it alone.  It'd be worse if it were a bunch of kids in rainbow shirts that kicked their asses too.   Remember the dick measuring contest thing?  They would start to shoot each other to make their points and pick a new leader on the spot.  And any plans fall apart."

Then they settled into the pews and listened as their pastor warned of the “many people” in the country who were “trying to destroy everything that is righteous and good and pure and holy.” They were the sort, he said, who were demanding free condoms at school, “gender fluidity books” in the public library and drag queen story hours.

>By his own admission, Moss had not paid much attention to local politics. He ran a small technology business and was focused on raising his children. Then, in the fall of 2020, the Ottawa County health department learned of a coronavirus outbreak at his daughter’s Christian school and ordered the school’s leaders to comply with the governor’s mask mandate. When they refused, state and county officials chained shut the school’s doors for more than a week and warned parents that continued resistance could bring fines and imprisonment.

>Suddenly, Moss realized that those dangerous people that his pastor had been talking about on Sundays were not just in Washington and Lansing, the state capital. They were in West Olive, where the county government was headquartered. “In 2020, I became a threatened parent,” Moss said on the campaign trail. “I was threatened specifically … by Ottawa County.”

Exactly what I've been saying for years. The reason the Democratic party can't seem to pull left, is because of all the original moderate Republicans who have quietly changed parties. Eventually they'll find a new home in a new conservative party and we can work with them on isolating the dregs of the old Republican party."

Gorsuch (stolen from Obama), Kavanaugh (never properly investigated by the FBI), Barrett (should have been Biden's pick) and all three were picked by an illegitimate presidency, aided illegally by Russia, voted in by a minority of the electorate. In fact, the six conservative (Republican) members of the court were ""confirmed"" by a Senate majority representing about 43 million (!) fewer Americans than their Democratic counterparts, by the time that Amy Coney Barrett's nomination came up. And let's not even mention the five justices appointed by Republican presidents who lost the popular vote, and are only there because of that remnant of the slavocracy, the Electoral College.

This is a radical, runaway, reactionary, right wing court that is nothing more now than an adjunct to the Republican Party. It is only concerned with maintaining minority white Christian rule, and the Constitution be damned.

When Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis came to Washington this week to try to woo lawmakers ahead of his likely White House run, only a dozen reportedly showed up.

That was no surprise to former Michigan Rep. Dave Trott, who reached out to Politico, without prompting, to describe exactly what DeSantis was like in person. “If you’re going to go into politics, kind of a fundamental skill that you should have is likability. I don’t think \[he\] has that,” Trott told Politico.

His stilted style and disinterest in talking to those who could help him is obvious at any public event. His awkward personality has been well-covered for months. 

The major GOP donors he’ll need to woo in order fill his campaign coffers have found it deeply off-putting. And while his landslide 2022 win and lengthy record of policy wins is powering his support with the GOP base nationally, the more voters see of him, the more they’ll see of his personality.

The GOP is taking many of the same steps that the Nazis did to start genocide and enact a coup. And they are using our legal system against us because most people believe a law is only passed if the majority of people support it. And then they feel as if they have no position questioning a law if it seems unjust. 

How many times have we heard, “if people want abortion to be legal then they’ll legalize it in their states”, only to watch the GOP do everything they can to make sure minority opinions dictate the laws that are made? Same goes with countless other topics. They pass laws pretending it is popular legislation when it is anything but and then it takes forever to remove the laws and often they don’t get struck down at all.

Again, the GOP is using our legal system against us. They are going to make it legal to commit genocide against minority groups and they will attempt to convince voters it is okay because it is legal.

>Between September to January of this year, mink in three Polish farms tested positive for the pandemic coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2— presenting a concerning mystery as to how the animals became infected.

>While previous mink outbreaks have linked to infected farmworkers and local circulation of the virus—indicating human-to-mink spread—none of the farm workers or families in the recently affected farms tested positive for the virus. 

>In fact, health investigators found that the infected mink carried a strain of SARS-CoV-2 that has not been seen in humans in the region in more than two years (B.1.1.307).

>The finding suggests that humans were not responsible for infecting the mink—at least not directly. Rather, it suggests that another unknown species may have been stealthily harboring and spreading the otherwise bygone strain for some time and managed to carry it onto the mink farms.

>&nbsp;

>The suggestion raises more concern over viral ""spillback."" The term relates to the more recognized ""spillover,"" when a virus jumps from a host population—a reservoir—to a new population, such as humans. 

>SARS-CoV-2 is thought to have originated in a reservoir of horseshoe bats before it reached humans. Since then, it is clear that it can also infect a broad range of animals, including rodents, cats, dogs, white-tail deer, non-human primates, as well as ferrets and mink. 

>Researchers fear that the virus could spill back to an animal population that could become a new reservoir from which the virus could periodically move back to humans.

The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to investigate the diagnostic, the dimensional mean-level, and rank-order stability of personality disorders (PDs) and PD criteria over time. EMBASE, PsycInfo, PubMed, and Web of Science were searched for peer-reviewed studies published in either English, German, or French between the first publication of the third edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-III) in 1980 and December 20, 2022. 

Inclusion criteria were a prospective longitudinal study design, assessing the stability of PDs or PD criteria over at least two measurement occasions at least one month apart, and using the same assessment at baseline and follow-up. Effect sizes included proportion of enduring cases (i.e., diagnostic stability), test–retest correlations (i.e., dimensional rank-order stability), and within-group standardized mean differences (i.e., dimensional mean-level stability), based on the first and last available measurement occasion. 

From an initial pool of 1473 studies, 40 were included in our analyses, covering 38,432 participants. 56.7% maintained the diagnosis of any PD, and 45.2% maintained the diagnosis of borderline PD over time. Findings on the dimensional mean-level stability indicate that most PD criteria significantly decreased from baseline to follow-up, except for antisocial, obsessive-compulsive, and schizoid PD criteria. Findings on the dimensional rank-order stability suggested moderate estimates, except for antisocial PD criteria, which were found to be high. Findings indicated that both PDs and PD criteria were only moderately stable, although between study heterogeneity was high, and stability itself depended on several methodological factors."

People don't genarally have a mental disorder for no reason, there's usually either a physical issue (hormone imbalances, genetic conditions, brain trauma or difference in structure etc) or severe emotional trauma. unfortunately a lot of health care providers will only treat symptoms without further looking into *why* someone is experiencing mental issues.


You cannot just look at surface level symptoms, deem them to be mental illness and stop investigating immediately, many people's mental issues are caused by underlying health problems. For example many people are wrongly diagnosed with bipolar disorder when they actually have a thyroid condition which is much better managed with HRT, many people with psychosis have been found to have abnormal vitamin/metal build up that's damaging their brain and a simple pill/diet change has completely cured them.
It stands to reason that aswell as therapies helping people to recover from a trauma related mental illness it's possible that others bodys can also randomly re-regulate themselves causing what seems to be an inexplicable sudden recovery (or sudden declines). 


I urge anyone facing mental illness to try to dive further into their physical health to rule out the possibility that your mental condition isn't something more, and more importantly something curable or that can be better managed with a different approach. Get hormone tests, get mri scans, get bloods taken and get seccond opinions. Don't accept ""that's just how you are"" if you know you haven't been properly investigated. Sometimes it is ""just how you are"" but it doesn't hurt to be thorough when it comes to your health."

* By ""early"" sexual activity they mean 12-14. This is below the age of consent in most (all?) states for good reason, and it's reasonable to assume that many of these cases of early sexual activity were coercive. It's not exactly surprising that statutory rape, child sexual abuse, and sex before you are developmentally ready and able to consent lead to mental health problems. I think this should be called something other than ""early sexual activity"" to clarify that these are potentially (likely?) non consensual experiences.
* Their graphs showing these relationships and the outcome of their statistical tests are very messy - it looks like there's a ton of variation and their lines of best fit are... not very good fits. These aren't particularly strong correlations.
* I'm frustrated by the fact that they don't provide more information on what they mean by risky activity, early sexual activity, high number of partners (I believe they mean 2+), etc or the age range of study participants. It's implied that this is limited to adolescents, but I'd like more information.
* The association between early sexual activity/high number of partners and depression is higher for girls. They hypothesize that this is related to risk of STIs and pregnancy. A glaringly obvious omission is that these girls may be exploited by older males...again, we're talking about 12-14 year old girls here. Even if their partners are the same age (statistically, this isn't usually the case) teenage boys are not always kind. Social factors seem like a pretty obvious potential reason."

Background  
Early sexual intercourse and a greater number of sexual partners have been proved associated with depression. However, the causality of these associations is not clear.  
  
Methods  
To unveil the causal associations between sexual factors and major depression disorder (MDD). The bidirectional, two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) study was conducted, which used genetic variants associated with two sexual factors (age first had sexual intercourse, n = 406,457; lifetime number of sexual partners, n = 378,882) and MDD (n = 500,199) from the largest genome-wide association studies (GWASs) conducted by the UK biobank and the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium. The two-step MR analysis was applied to assess mediation. The Genetic predictors for five risky behaviors were also obtained from the most up-to-date GWAS conducted by the UK Biobank (ever self-harmed: 117,733; ever attempted suicide: 4933; psychoactive substance abuse, alcohol use, and tobacco use: 463,010).  
  
Results  
MR analysis indicated a risky causal effect of age first had sexual intercourse (OR = 0.720, 95 % CI: 0.661–0.784, P = 2.45 × 10−14) and lifetime number of sexual partners (OR = 1.656, 95 % CI: 1.356–2.022, P = 7.46 × 10−7) on MDD. Mediation analysis showed the effects were mediated by tobacco use, with a proportion of 34.20 % on age first had sexual intercourse and 22.94 % on lifetime number of sexual partners separately.  
  
Limitations  
The overlap of participants in different traits and unclear gender.  
  
Conclusions  
Robust genetic evidence indicated that premature sexual intercourse and more sexual partners were risks for MDD. Risky behaviors, especially the tobacco use, mediated this effect."

Background  
Temperament has been shown to be associated with the change of gut microbiome. There were no longitudinal studies to explore the role of gut microbiome changes in the development of temperament in toddlers.  
  
Methods  
This study used longitudinal cohort to investigate the associations between changes in gut microbiome and temperament in toddlers in the first two years of life. Linear regression analysis and microbiome multivariate association with linear models were used to investigate the associations between the gut microbiome and toddlers' temperament.  
  
Results  
In total, 41 toddlers were analyzed. This study found both Shannon and Chao-1 indices at birth were negatively correlated with the sadness dimension; the higher the Shannon and Chao-1 indices at 6 months, the lower the surgency/extraversion dimension scores; the higher the Shannon and Chao-1 indices at 2 years of ages, the lower the cuddliness dimension scores. After adjusting for covariates, beta diversity at birth was strongly associated with the negative affectivity dimension; beta diversity at 1 year of age was strongly associated with the activity level dimension; and beta diversity at 2 years of age was strongly associated with the discomfort and soothability dimension. Compared to Bifidobacterium cluster, this study also found Bacteroides cluster was associated with lower negative affectivity and its sub-dimensions frustration and sadness scores in toddlers.  
  
Limitations  
Generalizability of the results remains to be determined.

Humans are continuously exposed to polymeric materials such as in textiles, car tires and packaging. Unfortunately, their break down products pollute our environment, leading to widespread contamination with micro- and nanoplastics (MNPs). The blood–brain barrier (BBB) is an important biological barrier that protects the brain from harmful substances. In our study we performed short term uptake studies in mice with orally administered polystyrene micro-/nanoparticles (9.55 µm, 1.14 µm, 0.293 µm). We show that nanometer sized particles—but not bigger particles—reach the brain within only 2 h after gavage. To understand the transport mechanism, we performed coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations on the interaction of DOPC bilayers with a polystyrene nanoparticle in the presence and absence of various coronae. We found that the composition of the biomolecular corona surrounding the plastic particles was critical for passage through the BBB. Cholesterol molecules enhanced the uptake of these contaminants into the membrane of the BBB, whereas the protein model inhibited it. These opposing effects could explain the passive transport of the particles into the brain.

>An in vivo wound naturally generates an EF, which points radially towards the wound center. Electrically speaking, the wound center acts like a current sink (i.e., cathode) surrounded by an ionic current source (i.e., anode). When designing the microfluidic device, it is this principle that we mimic.

So the faster healing is done by mimicking the bodies natural process, but by increasing the intensity.

This experiment used a kind of skin cell, keratinocytes.

>We found that uni-directional electric guidance cues were superior in group keratinocyte healing dynamics by **enhancing the wound closure rate nearly three-fold for both healthy and diabetic-like keratinocyte** collectives, compared to their non-stimulated respective controls."

Using electric stimulation, researchers in a project at Chalmers University of Technology, Sweden, and the University of Freiburg, Germany, have developed a method that speeds up the healing process, making wounds heal three times faster.

“Chronic wounds are a huge societal problem that we don’t hear a lot about. Our discovery of a method that may heal wounds up to three times faster can be a game changer for diabetic and elderly people, among others, who often suffer greatly from wounds that won’t heal,” said Maria Asplund, Associate Professor of Bioelectronics at Chalmers University of Technology and head of research on the project.

The researchers worked from an old hypothesis that electric stimulation of damaged skin can be used to heal wounds. The idea is that skin cells are electrotactic, which means that they directionally ‘migrate’ in electric fields. This means that if an electric field is placed in a petri dish with skin cells, the cells stop moving randomly and start moving in the same direction. The researchers investigated how this principle can be used to electrically guide the cells in order to make wounds heal faster. Using a tiny engineered chip, the researchers were able to compare wound healing in artificial skin, stimulating one wound with electricity and letting one heal without electricity. The differences were striking. 

“We were able to show that the old hypothesis about electric stimulation can be used to make wounds heal significantly faster. In order to study exactly how this works for wounds, we developed a kind of biochip on which we cultured skin cells, which we then made tiny wounds in. Then we stimulated one wound with an electric field, which clearly led to it healing three times as fast as the wound that healed without electric stimulation,” Asplund commented.

Background  
Saccadic eye movement (SEM) has been considered a non-invasive potential biomarker for the diagnosis of depression in recent years, but its application is not yet mature. In this study, we used eye-tracking technology to identify the eye movements of patients with depression to develop a new method for objectively identifying depression.  
  
Methods  
Thirty-six patients with depression as the depression group, while thirty-six matched healthy individuals as the control group were recruited and completed eye movement tests, including two tasks: the prosaccade task and the antisaccade task. iViewX RED 500 eye-tracking instruments from SMI were used to collect eye movement data for both groups.  
  
Results  
In the prosaccade task, there was no difference between the depression and control groups(t = 0.019， P > 0.05). In general, with increasing angle, both groups showed significantly higher peak velocity (F = 81.72， P < 0.0001), higher mean velocity (F = 32.83, P = 0.000), and greater SEM amplitude (F = 24.23, P < 0.0001). In the antisaccade task, there were significant differences in correct rate (t = 3.219, P = 0.002) and mean velocity (F = 3.253， P < 0.05) between the depression group and the control group. In the anti-effect analysis, there were significant differences in correct rate (F = 67.44, P < 0.0001) and accuracy (F = 79.02, P < 0.0001) between the depression group and the control group. Both groups showed longer latency and worse correct rate and precision in the antisaccade task compared with the prosaccade task.  
  
Conclusion  
Patients with depression showed different eye movement features, which could be potential biomarkers for clinical identification. Further studies must validate these results with larger sample sizes and more clinical populations."

That's insane that 1/4 of them got shot later on!

Results like these, while obvious, can help inform policy and intervention efforts. 

From this study, we know that, even if it's 10 times more difficult to reach these kids with interventions, it's worth focusing on them because the potential effect of successful intervention is around 23 times more likely to prevent them from getting shot.

>Mitochondria are hubs where bioenergetics, redox homeostasis, and anabolic metabolism pathways integrate through a tightly coordinated flux of metabolites. The contributions of mitochondrial metabolism to tumor growth and therapy resistance are evident, but drugs targeting mitochondrial metabolism have repeatedly failed in the clinic. Our study in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) finds that cellular and mitochondrial lipid composition influence cancer cell sensitivity to pharmacological inhibition of electron transport chain complex I. Profiling of patient-derived PDAC models revealed that monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) and MUFA-linked ether phospholipids play a critical role in maintaining ROS homeostasis. We show that ether phospholipids support mitochondrial supercomplex assembly and ROS production; accordingly, blocking de novo ether phospholipid biosynthesis sensitized PDAC cells to complex I inhibition by inducing mitochondrial ROS and lipid peroxidation. These data identify ether phospholipids as a regulator of mitochondrial redox control that contributes to the sensitivity of PDAC cells to complex I inhibition."
989,"Most people feel 'psychologically close' to climate change. Research showed that over 50% of participants actually believe that climate change is happening either now or in the near future and that it will impact their local areas, not just faraway places.",6,science,12w5np0,https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2590332223001409,2,"There is no consistent evidence that perceiving climate change as psychologically distant hinders climate action, with studies reporting mixed results,"" write the authors, led by Dr. Anne M. van Valkengoed of the University of Groningen in the Netherlands.

van Valkengoed and her colleagues collected results from public opinion polls surveying people about their views on climate change, some of which included over 100,000 people from 121 different countries. The polls showed that over 50% of participants actually believe that climate change is happening either now or in the near future and that it will impact their local areas, not just faraway places.

The team also looked at the results of several studies designed to test the relationship between psychological distance and climate action. Out of 26 reviewed studies, only nine found a positive association between psychological distance and climate action. In fact, some studies showed that viewing climate change as impacting distant places and communities made people want to take more action. The researchers also found that 25 out of 30 studies failed to prove that experimentally decreasing psychological distance increased climate action.

The pervasive misconception about the relationship between psychological distance and climate action could actually be impeding progress in mitigating climate change due to social influence, suggest the authors. For example, if people think others perceive climate change as psychologically distant and therefore aren't taking action, they might be less likely to act themselves. Also, they might think that their efforts are futile because real environmental change relies on the combined efforts of many.

>For centuries, society has scorned bogs, fens and swamps — collectively known as peatlands — treating them as wastelands available to be drained and developed without realizing they’re important buffers against climate-changing carbon emissions.
>
>...
>
>A majority of all the world’s peatlands are found in northern regions. Layered by waterlogged peat topped by living mosses, these peatlands absorb and expel carbon, typically storing a little more than they give off, making them carbon sinks over time. Over thousands of years, they have stockpiled massive amounts of carbon. 
>
>Collectively, peatlands hold more carbon than all the world’s forests. Peatlands account for just three per cent of the world’s land mass but hold about a third of the planet’s stored soil carbon, making them Earth’s most carbon-dense ecosystems.
>
>However, peatlands are under pressure everywhere. They are affected by rising temperatures, drought, wildfire and various human actions, including drainage. In this process of draining, the water from the peatlands is allowed to run off through dug-out ditches, thus making the wetland drier.
>
>Individual bogs are drained for agriculture, mining, urban development, wind turbine placement or peat harvesting. So far, between seven and 10 per cent of all northern peatlands have been drained.
>
>...
>
>In our recently published paper, we found that the direct threat from drainage, coupled with climate-change enhanced wildfires, is accelerating the release of carbon from these peatlands. Simply put, our actions are turning climate-friendly peatlands into liabilities, with potentially devastating consequences.
>
>Our study of natural, degraded and restored forms of peatlands in boreal and temperate regions revealed that the once stable carbon-storing power of our northern peatlands is gradually losing to the effects of fire, and drained peatlands are the biggest culprits for this.
>
>Compromising the healthy peatlands that remain — even if it’s for otherwise beneficial uses such as growing food or helping us move away from fossil fuels — could backfire badly, especially as climatic conditions worsen.
>
>We found that without deliberate restoration efforts for already drained peatlands, and protection for those that remain, our carbon-collecting northern bogs could flip to carbon contributors by the end of this century. This will further accelerate the overall pace of global warming and climate change.
>
>...
>
>Our research shows that it is not only critical to keep our peatlands from burning up, but that there is also an important and viable opportunity to mitigate this impending disaster. But the window for action is shrinking quickly. 

Unfortunately, peatlands have thus far failed to capture the public's imagination and worse, are still viewed as undesirable landscapes. Their richness, biodiversity, and ecological importance though needs to be continually emphasized so that the public can begin to understand both their beauty as well as their critical roles in our biosphere."

[Wildfire and degradation accelerate northern peatland carbon release](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-023-01657-w).

Abstract:

>The northern peatland carbon sink plays a vital role in climate regulation; however, the future of the carbon sink is uncertain, in part, due to the changing interactions of peatlands and wildfire. Here, we use empirical datasets from natural, degraded and restored peatlands in non-permafrost boreal and temperate regions to model net ecosystem exchange and methane fluxes, integrating peatland degradation status, wildfire combustion and post-fire dynamics. We find that wildfire processes reduced carbon uptake in pristine peatlands by 35% and further enhanced emissions from degraded peatlands by 10%. The current small net sink is vulnerable to the interactions of peatland degraded area, burn rate and peat burn severity. Climate change impacts accelerated carbon losses, where increased burn severity and burn rate reduced the carbon sink by 38% and 65%, respectively, by 2100. However, our study demonstrates the potential for active peatland restoration to buffer these impacts."

996,Influence of aspirin on aging skeletal muscle: Insights from a cross-sectional cohort of septuagenarians (Apr 2023),17,science,12vwdzg,https://physoc.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.14814/phy2.15669,2,"
Abstract:
>Aspirin is one of the most commonly consumed cyclooxygenase (COX)-inhibitors and anti-inflammatory drugs and has been shown to block COX-produced regulators of inflammation and aging skeletal muscle size. We used propensity score matching to compare skeletal muscle characteristics of individuals from the Health ABC study that did not consume aspirin or any other COX-inhibiting drugs (non-consumers, n = 497, 74 ± 3 year, 168 ± 9 cm, 75.1 ± 13.8 kg, 33.1 ± 7.4% body fat, 37% women, 34% black) to those that consumed aspirin daily (and not any other COX-inhibiting drugs) and for at least 1 year (aspirin consumers, n = 515, 74 ± 3 year, 168 ± 9 cm, 76.2 ± 13.6 kg, 33.8 ± 7.1% body fat, 39% women, 30% black, average aspirin consumption: 6 year). Subjects were matched (p > 0.05) based on age, height, weight, % body fat, sex, and race (propensity scores: 0.33 ± 0.09 vs. 0.33 ± 0.09, p > 0.05). There was no difference between non-consumers and aspirin consumers for computed tomography-determined muscle size of the quadriceps (103.5 ± 0.9 vs. 104.9 ± 0.8 cm2, p > 0.05) or hamstrings (54.6 ± 0.5 vs. 54.9 ± 0.5 cm2, p > 0.05), or quadriceps muscle strength (111.1 ± 2.0 vs. 111.7 ± 2.0 Nm, p > 0.05). However, muscle attenuation (i.e., density) was higher in the aspirin consumers in the quadriceps (40.9 ± 0.3 vs. 44.4 ± 0.3 Hounsfield unit [HU], p < 0.05) and hamstrings (27.7 ± 0.4 vs. 33.2 ± 0.4 HU, p < 0.05). These cross sectional data suggest that chronic aspirin consumption does not influence age-related skeletal muscle atrophy, but does influence skeletal muscle composition in septuagenarians. Prospective longitudinal investigations remain necessary to better understand the influence of chronic COX regulation on aging skeletal muscle health."

Abstract  
Multiprincipal-element alloys are an enabling class of materials owing to their impressive mechanical and oxidation-resistant properties, especially in extreme environments. Here we develop a new oxide-dispersion-strengthened NiCoCr-based alloy using a model-driven alloy design approach and laser-based additive manufacturing. This oxide-dispersion-strengthened alloy, called GRX-810, uses laser powder bed fusion to disperse nanoscale Y2O3 particles throughout the microstructure without the use of resource-intensive processing steps such as mechanical or in situ alloying. We show the successful incorporation and dispersion of nanoscale oxides throughout the GRX-810 build volume via high-resolution characterization of its microstructure. The mechanical results of GRX-810 show a twofold improvement in strength, over 1,000-fold better creep performance and twofold improvement in oxidation resistance compared with the traditional polycrystalline wrought Ni-based alloys used extensively in additive manufacturing at 1,093 °C. The success of this alloy highlights how model-driven alloy designs can provide superior compositions using far fewer resources compared with the ‘trial-and-error’ methods of the past. These results showcase how future alloy development that leverages dispersion strengthening combined with additive manufacturing processing can accelerate the discovery of revolutionary materials."

>Abstract:

>New Findings

>- **What is the central question of this study?**

>Ageing leads to a loss of mass in skeletal muscle, but the effect of obesity on ageing-related muscle wasting is unclear. In this study, we aimed to demonstrate the specific effect of obesity on fast-twitch skeletal muscle in ageing.

>- **What is the main finding and its importance?**

>Our findings show that the obesity induced by long-term ingestion of a high-fat diet does not aggravate muscle wasting in fast-twitch skeletal muscle of aged mice, indicating that the present study provides morphological characteristics for skeletal muscle of sarcopenic obesity.

>Obesity and ageing reduce muscle mass and lead to deficits in muscle maintenance, but it is not known whether obesity accelerates muscle wasting additively in the setting of ageing. We investigated morphological characteristics in fast-twitch extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscle of mice fed a low-fat diet (LFD) or a high-fat diet (HFD) for 4 or 20 months. The fast-twitch EDL muscle was harvested, and the muscle fibre-type composition, individual muscle cross-sectional area and myotube diameter were measured. We found an increase in the percentage of type IIa and IIx myosin heavy chain fibres in the whole EDL muscle, but a decrease in type IIB myosin heavy chain in both HFD protocols. The cross-sectional area and myofibre diameter were lower in both groups of aged mice (after 20 months of LFD or HFD) compared with young mice (after 4 months of the diets), but there were no differences between mice fed LFD or HFD for 20 months. These data suggest that long-term feeding of HFD does not aggravate muscle wasting in fast-twitch EDL muscle of male mice."
1008,Diet suppresses glioblastoma initiation in mice by maintaining quiescence of mutation-bearing neural stem cells (Apr 2023),9,science,12vxclt,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S153458072300148X?via%3Dihub,2,"**Highlights**

• p53 maintains neural stem cell quiescence by inducing fatty-acid oxidation (FAO)

• p53 loss prematurely activates neural stem cells during gliomagenesis

• Restoration of FAO through diet reinstates quiescence to suppress tumor initiation

**Summary**

Glioblastoma is thought to originate from neural stem cells (NSCs) of the subventricular zone that acquire genetic alterations. In the adult brain, NSCs are largely quiescent, suggesting that deregulation of quiescence maintenance may be a prerequisite for tumor initiation. Although inactivation of the tumor suppressor p53 is a frequent event in gliomagenesis, whether or how it affects quiescent NSCs (qNSCs) remains unclear. Here, we show that p53 maintains quiescence by inducing fatty-acid oxidation (FAO) and that acute p53 deletion in qNSCs results in their premature activation to a proliferative state. Mechanistically, this occurs through direct transcriptional induction of PPARGC1a, which in turn activates PPARα to upregulate FAO genes. Dietary supplementation with fish oil containing omega-3 fatty acids, natural PPARα ligands, fully restores quiescence of p53-deficient NSCs and delays tumor initiation in a glioblastoma mouse model. Thus, diet can silence glioblastoma driver mutations, with important implications for cancer prevention."
1009,Irreversible electroporation augments β-glucan induced trained innate immunity for the treatment of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinom (Apr 2023),9,science,12vx13c,https://jitc.bmj.com/content/11/4/e006221,2,"Abstract

**Background** Pancreatic cancer (PC) is a challenging diagnosis that is yet to benefit from the advancements in immuno-oncologic treatments. Irreversible electroporation (IRE), a non-thermal method of tumor ablation, is used in treatment of select patients with locally-advanced unresectable PC and has potentiated the effect of certain immunotherapies. Yeast-derived particulate β-glucan induces trained innate immunity and successfully reduces murine PC tumor burden. This study tests the hypothesis that IRE may augment β-glucan induced trained immunity in the treatment of PC.

**Methods** β-Glucan-trained pancreatic myeloid cells were evaluated ex vivo for trained responses and antitumor function after exposure to ablated and unablated tumor-conditioned media. β-Glucan and IRE combination therapy was tested in an orthotopic murine PC model in wild-type and Rag−/− mice. Tumor immune phenotypes were assessed by flow cytometry. Effect of oral β-glucan in the murine pancreas was evaluated and used in combination with IRE to treat PC. The peripheral blood of patients with PC taking oral β-glucan after IRE was evaluated by mass cytometry.

**Results** IRE-ablated tumor cells elicited a potent trained response ex vivo and augmented antitumor functionality. In vivo, β-glucan in combination with IRE reduced local and distant tumor burden prolonging survival in a murine orthotopic PC model. This combination augmented immune cell infiltration to the PC tumor microenvironment and potentiated the trained response from tumor-infiltrating myeloid cells. The antitumor effect of this dual therapy occurred independent of the adaptive immune response. Further, orally administered β-glucan was identified as an alternative route to induce trained immunity in the murine pancreas and prolonged PC survival in combination with IRE. β-Glucan in vitro treatment also induced trained immunity in peripheral blood monocytes obtained from patients with treatment-naïve PC. Finally, orally administered β-glucan was found to significantly alter the innate cell landscape within the peripheral blood of five patients with stage III locally-advanced PC who had undergone IRE.

**Conclusions** These data highlight a relevant and novel application of trained immunity within the setting of surgical ablation that may stand to benefit patients with PC.



>WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPIC

>- Recent evidence has demonstrated that inducing trained immunity by Bacillus-Calmette-Guérin and influenza vaccines, as well as natural compounds such as β-glucans, is capable of reducing tumor progression and controlling tumor metastasis. It is critical to understand how tumor cells elicit a trained response and whether the intensity or level of trained immunity is associated with therapeutic efficacy.

>WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS

>- We demonstrated that irreversible electroporation (IRE)-ablated tumor cells elicited a potent trained response and augmented antitumor innate immunity. In vivo, β-glucan in combination with IRE reduced local and distant tumor burden, prolonging survival in a murine orthotopic pancreatic cancer (PC) model. Orally administered β-glucan in patients with stage III PC who had undergone IRE also induced a trained immunity phenotype in peripheral monocytes.

>HOW THIS STUDY MIGHT AFFECT RESEARCH, PRACTICE OR POLICY

>- Based on our findings, it is suggested that inducing trained immunity in patients with PC may elicit antitumor innate immunity and augment the current immunotherapeutic modalities, such as immune checkpoint blockade therapy."

Summary:

  
Insulin inhibits gluconeogenesis and stimulates glucose conversion to glycogen and lipids. How these activities are coordinated to prevent hypoglycemia and hepatosteatosis is unclear. Fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBP1) is rate controlling for gluconeogenesis. However, inborn human FBP1 deficiency does not cause hypoglycemia unless accompanied by fasting or starvation, which also trigger paradoxical hepatomegaly, hepatosteatosis, and hyperlipidemia. Hepatocyte FBP1-ablated mice exhibit identical fasting-conditional pathologies along with AKT hyperactivation, whose inhibition reversed hepatomegaly, hepatosteatosis, and hyperlipidemia but not hypoglycemia. Surprisingly, fasting-mediated AKT hyperactivation is insulin dependent. Independently of its catalytic activity, FBP1 prevents insulin hyperresponsiveness by forming a stable complex with AKT, PP2A-C, and aldolase B (ALDOB), which specifically accelerates AKT dephosphorylation. Enhanced by fasting and weakened by elevated insulin, FBP1:PP2A-C:ALDOB:AKT complex formation, which is disrupted by human FBP1 deficiency mutations or a C-terminal FBP1 truncation, prevents insulin-triggered liver pathologies and maintains lipid and glucose homeostasis. Conversely, an FBP1-derived complex disrupting peptide reverses diet-induced insulin resistance.

**Abstract:**

>Hornets are the largest of the social wasps, and are important regulators of insect populations in their native ranges. Hornets are also very successful as invasive species, with often devastating economic, ecological and societal effects. Understanding why these wasps are such successful invaders is critical to managing future introductions and minimising impact on native biodiversity. Critical to the management toolkit is a comprehensive genomic resource for these insects. Here we provide the annotated genomes for two hornets, Vespa crabro and Vespa velutina. We compare their genomes with those of other social Hymenoptera, including the northern giant hornet Vespa mandarinia. The three hornet genomes show evidence of selection pressure on genes associated with reproduction, which might facilitate the transition into invasive ranges. Vespa crabro has experienced positive selection on the highest number of genes, including those putatively associated with molecular binding and olfactory systems. Caste-specific brain transcriptomic analysis also revealed 133 differentially expressed genes, some of which are associated with olfactory functions. This report provides a spring-board for advancing our understanding of the evolution and ecology of hornets, and opens up opportunities for using molecular methods in the future management of both native and invasive populations of these over-looked insects."

From the paper:

""Neuromorphic systems that can learn, remember, and adapt to external time-varying stimuli would represent a breakthrough platform for neuro-inspired computing.

The present study demonstrates the potential for (nanowire network) NWNs to achieve this. 

The ability to process dynamically changing information is key in many real world applications, such as robotics and sensor edge devices, where there is a need to make on-the-fly decisions in a nondeterministic environment.

In conclusion, by applying supervised and reinforcement learning strategies similar to those operating in the brain, we have demonstrated (working memory) WM and memory consolidation in NWNs.

These higher-order cognitive functions were achieved by implementing a nontrivial cognitive task routinely applied to human subjects. 

Results reveal that neuromorphic learning paradigms implemented in NWNs leverage similar mechanisms to the brain, namely, synaptic metaplasticity and synaptic strengthening and pruning, to optimize WM and memory consolidation."""

They measured the biological age of the young mice. It looked older than young mice ought to look.

I am having trouble with this. Maybe I just didn't look into it enough, but wouldn't joining the circulatory systems just mean they were measuring the old mice's biological ages just after being filtered through the young mice? 

Or is this more saying old blood in young tissue causes that tissue to behave as though it is older, possibly elucidating  *one of* the mechanisms behind tissue behaving oldly?

Can anyone that works in this field shed some light?

Biological age refers to an individual's physiological age, which can differ from their chronological age based on factors such as lifestyle, environment, and genetics.  
  
Chronic stress can lead to an acceleration of the aging process and may increase the risk of age-related diseases such as cardiovascular disease, cognitive decline, and some types of cancer. This is thought to occur through various mechanisms, including increased inflammation, oxidative stress, and changes in telomere length and function.  
  
However, studies have also shown that recovery from stress can help restore biological age. For example, a study published in the journal PLOS ONE found that participants who experienced reduced stress levels over a 10-year period had longer telomeres, a marker of cellular aging, than those who reported higher stress levels.  
  
Other research has suggested that certain lifestyle factors such as exercise, healthy eating, and social support may help counteract the negative effects of stress on biological aging.  
  
While the relationship between stress and biological age is complex and not yet fully understood, it does appear that stress can have an impact on aging and that recovery and healthy lifestyle choices may help mitigate some of these effects.

>Lead author, Dr Nadine Dijkstra (Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging at UCL) said: “In daily life, we often imagine things that are not there. For example, if we are asked whether a cat’s ears are round or pointy, we might inspect a mental image in our mind’s eye to answer the question.

>“Neuroscience has discovered that imagination and perception rely on overlapping brain circuits. We were interested in whether this overlap leads to confusion between the two: given that the same circuits are involved – how can we be sure what is real and what is not?”

>The research, published in *Nature Communications*, involved over 600 participants who took part in an online experiment, where they were asked to imagine images of alternating black and white lines while looking at a computer screen.

>The results showed that the imagined and perceived stimuli became intermixed in the participants’ minds.

>The researchers used a computer model to establish whether the pattern of results was consistent with the theory that people judge whether something is real or imagined, based on how vividly they experience it.

>The team validated this model using neuroimaging, showing that the brain encodes the strength or vividness of real and imagined stimuli in a similar manner – confusing reality and imagination.

>Dr Dijkstra, said: “Our results suggest that, counterintuitively, there is no categorical difference between imagination and reality; instead, it is a difference in degree, not in kind.”

We are logical beings that have caveman hardware.
Derren Brown performs amazing memory feats. In his book Trick of the Mind he instructs the readers how to memorise the order of a deck of cards. Rather than using a logical memorization of positions and cards e.g 1st: Jack spades. 2nd: 4 hearts.
We instead use a specific images to make a story of each card.

Number 1 is a bun. Jack of spades is a young boy with a spade.
We imagine a young boy halfway through digging a hole. His hands muddy, eating a sticky bun. We imagine the colours of the mud contrasting on his red shirt. The smell of grass. By attempting to make the image vivid and involve multiple senses we create a concrete memory that we can recall long after the fact compared to a list of numbers and letters.

A new [study](https://doi.org/10.3389/fspor.2023.1113952) in Frontiers in Sports and Active Living found that greater breast support during running is associated with increased knee joint stiffness, altering the lower body biomechanics of female runners. Specifically, a low support bra was associated with a 2% increase in knee joint stiffness, and a high support bra with 5%.

Running is one of the most accessible forms of exercise with an array of proven cardiovascular and musculoskeletal benefits, and an added bonus of increased mental health. Good quality running gear, such as the right pair of shoes, is vital to improve running performance and reduce injury risk. For women particularly, a well-designed sports bra protects from exercise-induced breast pain, which can be a significant barrier to practicing sports. Up to 72% of women experience breast pain while running.

Previous research has shown that the increased breast support sports bras offer not only influences breast movement but can also positively influence running performance. Greater breast support has been linked to lower oxygen consumption and better range of motion.

Dr Douglas Powell and Hailey Fong and colleagues at the Breast Biomechanics Research Center at the University of Memphis wanted to further investigate the effect of a good sports bra on running biomechanics.

“The biomechanics underlying improved running performance with greater breast support are not well understood. Our study represents one of a series of research studies on the topic of breast support and whole body biomechanics,” explained Powell. “We wanted to identify strategies to reduce activity-induced breast pain for females, a group that makes up approximately 50% of the population.”

Specifically, Powell and his colleagues looked at the influence of breast support on knee joint stiffness during treadmill running. Knee joint stiffness is a biomechanical measure that indicates how resistant the knee joint is to movement when force is applied. Knee joint stiffness has been associated with lower oxygen consumption, improved running performance, and running-related injury.

A sample size of 12 recreational runners, aged between 18 and 35 years, with a self reported B-, C-, or D-cup were professionally fitted with two different sports bras: a high support bra and a low support bra. For the control condition, the participants were asked to perform the experiment bare chested. Each participant then performed three-minute running bouts in each of the three randomized breast support conditions (high, low, bare/control).

To collect the data the researchers used a 10-camera motion capture system and instrumented treadmill. The movements of the participants were tracked using individual retroreflective markers fitted on different parts of their bodies. The researchers used Visual3D to calculate knee joint excursions, while custom software was used to calculate knee joint stiffness and breast displacements during the stance phase of running in each experimental condition."

A global [study](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD001321.pub6/full) looking at the benefits of cranberry products published in Cochrane Reviews has determined cranberry juice, and its supplements, reduce the risk of repeat symptomatic UTIs in women by more than a quarter, in children by more than half, and in people susceptible to UTI following medical interventions by about 53%.

Cranberry juice and healthcare supplements that commonly include the fruit, such as capsules and tablets, have long been promoted as a readily available solution to ward off the infection but the most recent review in 2012, with evidence from 24 trials, showed no benefit from the products.

The medical scientists behind this updated review from Flinders University and The Children’s Hospital at Westmead aimed to update these findings, as an important step in determining the effectiveness of cranberry products by looking at 50 more recent trials that included almost 9000 participants.

“This incredible result didn’t really surprise us, as we’re taught that when there’s more and better evidence, the truth will ultimately come out. UTIs are horrible and very common; about a third of women will experience one, as will many elderly people and also people with bladder issues from spinal cord injury or other conditions,” says the study lead author Dr. Gabrielle Williams.

“Even back in 1973, my mum was told to try cranberry juice to prevent her horrible and frequent UTIs, and for her it’s been a saviour. Despite me niggling in her ear about evidence, she’s continued to take it daily, first as the nasty sour juice and in recent years, the easy to swallow capsules. As soon as she stops, wham the symptoms are back. As usual, it turns out that mum was right! Cranberry products can help some women prevent UTIs.”

Flinders University epidemiologist Dr. Jacqueline Stephens, a co-author of the study, says if the UTI persists untreated it can move to the kidneys and cause pain and more complications, including sepsis in very severe cases, so prevention is the most effective way to reduce risks.

“Most UTIs are effectively, and pretty quickly, treated with antibiotics, sometimes as little as one dose can cure the problem. Unfortunately, in some people UTIs keep coming back. Without being sure if or how it works, some healthcare providers began suggesting it to their patients.  It was a harmless, easy option at the time. Even centuries ago, Native Americans reportedly ate cranberries for bladder problems, leading somewhat more recently, to laboratory scientists exploring what it was in cranberries that helped and how it might work.”"

>Tasmanian devils (*Sarcophilus harrisii*) are carnivorous marsupials native to the island of Tasmania in southeast Australia. They are susceptible to two cancers that emerged separately: devil facial tumour 1 (DFT1) and devil facial tumour 2 (DFT2), which are both spread by biting. 

>Cancers that pass from one host to another are rare in nature, but can have devastating effects, says study co-author Rodrigo Hamede, a disease ecologist at the University of Tasmania in Hobart. 

>“In a matter of 10 years, we lost between 60–70% of the overall [devil] population,” he says.

>Although scientists have been aware of the two cancers for some time, little has been known about their evolution. To investigate, Hamede and his colleagues assembled a Tasmanian devil reference genome and compared it with DNA sequenced from 78 DFT1 and 41 DFT2 tumours. 

>The team then constructed ‘family trees’ of these tumours to track their origin and mapped their mutations to build a picture of how the diseases have evolved.

>Previous research has shown that Tasmanian devil populations are becoming more resilient, but the relatively recent emergence of DFT2 is concerning, says Hannah Siddle, a geneticist at the University of Queensland in Brisbane, Australia. 

>“It leaves the devil vulnerable in the wild, particularly in those regions where both tumours circulate,” she says. “This could induce local population crashes or as-yet unknown selection on the host population.”

The findings support piperacillin-tazobactam use as prophylaxis for this surgery.",25,science,12u17xy,https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2804245,3,"Key Points  
Question  Does use of perioperative broad-spectrum antibiotics reduce postoperative surgical site infection after open pancreatoduodenectomy?  
  
Findings  In this pragmatic, open-label, registry-linked randomized clinical trial including 778 participants from North America, the percentage of patients with 30-day postoperative surgical site infection was statistically significantly reduced with broad-spectrum piperacillin-tazobactam (19.8%) vs standard care cefoxitin (32.8%).  
  
Meaning  The findings support the use of piperacillin-tazobactam as perioperative antimicrobial prophylaxis for open pancreatoduodenectomy.  
  
Abstract  
Importance  Despite improvements in perioperative mortality, the incidence of postoperative surgical site infection (SSI) remains high after pancreatoduodenectomy. The effect of broad-spectrum antimicrobial surgical prophylaxis in reducing SSI is poorly understood.  
  
Objective  To define the effect of broad-spectrum perioperative antimicrobial prophylaxis on postoperative SSI incidence compared with standard care antibiotics.  
  
Design, Setting, and Participants  Pragmatic, open-label, multicenter, randomized phase 3 clinical trial at 26 hospitals across the US and Canada. Participants were enrolled between November 2017 and August 2021, with follow-up through December 2021. Adults undergoing open pancreatoduodenectomy for any indication were eligible. Individuals were excluded if they had allergies to study medications, active infections, chronic steroid use, significant kidney dysfunction, or were pregnant or breastfeeding. Participants were block randomized in a 1:1 ratio and stratified by the presence of a preoperative biliary stent. Participants, investigators, and statisticians analyzing trial data were unblinded to treatment assignment.  
  
Intervention  The intervention group received piperacillin-tazobactam (3.375 or 4 g intravenously) as perioperative antimicrobial prophylaxis, while the control group received cefoxitin (2 g intravenously; standard care).  
  
Main Outcomes and Measures  The primary outcome was development of postoperative SSI within 30 days. Secondary end points included 30-day mortality, development of clinically relevant postoperative pancreatic fistula, and sepsis. All data were collected as part of the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program.  
  
Results  The trial was terminated at an interim analysis on the basis of a predefined stopping rule. Of 778 participants (378 in the piperacillin-tazobactam group \[median age, 66.8 y; 233 {61.6%} men\] and 400 in the cefoxitin group \[median age, 68.0 y; 223 {55.8%} men\]), the percentage with SSI at 30 days was lower in the perioperative piperacillin-tazobactam vs cefoxitin group (19.8% vs 32.8%; absolute difference, −13.0% \[95% CI, −19.1% to −6.9%\]; P < .001). Participants treated with piperacillin-tazobactam, vs cefoxitin, had lower rates of postoperative sepsis (4.2% vs 7.5%; difference, −3.3% \[95% CI, −6.6% to 0.0%\]; P = .02) and clinically relevant postoperative pancreatic fistula (12.7% vs 19.0%; difference, −6.3% \[95% CI, −11.4% to −1.2%\]; P = .03). Mortality rates at 30 days were 1.3% (5/378) among participants treated with piperacillin-tazobactam and 2.5% (10/400) among those receiving cefoxitin (difference, −1.2% \[95% CI, −3.1% to 0.7%\]; P = .32).  
  
Conclusions and Relevance  In participants undergoing open pancreatoduodenectomy, use of piperacillin-tazobactam as perioperative prophylaxis reduced postoperative SSI, pancreatic fistula, and multiple downstream sequelae of SSI. The findings support the use of piperacillin-tazobactam as standard care for open pancreatoduodenectomy."

Abstract:
>The liver is one of the major organs involved in the regulation of glucose and lipid homeostasis. The effectiveness of metabolic activity in hepatocytes is determined by the quality and quantity of its mitochondria. Mitochondrial function is complex, and they act via various dynamic networks, which rapidly adapt to changes in the cellular milieu. Our present study aims to investigate the effects of low protein programming on the structure and function of mitochondria in the hepatocytes of adult females. Pregnant rats were fed with a control or isocaloric low-protein diet from gestational day 4 until delivery. A normal laboratory chow was given to all dams after delivery and to pups after weaning. The rats were euthanized at 4 months of age and the livers were collected from female offspring for investigating the mitochondrial structure, mtDNA copy number, mRNA, and proteins expression of genes associated with mitochondrial function. Primary hepatocytes were isolated and used for the analysis of the mitochondrial bioenergetics profiles. The mitochondrial ultrastructure showed that the in utero low-protein diet exposure led to increased mitochondrial fusion. Accordingly, there was an increase in the mRNA and protein levels of the mitochondrial fusion gene Opa1 and mitochondrial biogenesis genes Pgc1a and Essra, but Fis1, a fission gene, was downregulated. Low protein programming also impaired the mitochondrial function of the hepatocytes with a decrease in basal respiration ATP-linked respiration and proton leak. In summary, the present study suggests that the hepatic mitochondrial dysfunction induced by an in utero low protein diet might be a potential mechanism linking glucose intolerance and insulin resistance in adult offspring."

> Abstract

> Intracerebral vector delivery in nonhuman primates has been a major challenge. We report successful blood-brain barrier opening and focal delivery of adeno-associated virus serotype 9 vectors into brain regions involved in Parkinson’s disease using low-intensity focus ultrasound in adult macaque monkeys. Openings were well tolerated with generally no associated abnormal magnetic resonance imaging signals. Neuronal green fluorescent protein expression was observed specifically in regions with confirmed blood-brain barrier opening. Similar blood-brain barrier openings were safely demonstrated in three patients with Parkinson’s disease. In these patients and in one monkey, blood-brain barrier opening was followed by 18F-Choline uptake in the putamen and midbrain regions based on positron emission tomography. This indicates focal and cellular binding of molecules that otherwise would not enter the brain parenchyma. The less-invasive nature of this methodology could facilitate focal viral vector delivery for gene therapy and might allow early and repeated interventions to treat neurodegenerative disorders.

Media summary tag line:

> A study in monkeys and human patients shows how the blood-brain barrier can be crossed to allow the delivery of drugs that, in theory, could treat Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s

Some excerpts from the media summary article:

> This work has shown that the blood-brain barrier can be opened for a few precious hours to deliver the desired drugs to the brain. To achieve this, the researchers have used a very new technology: low-intensity focused ultrasound (LIFU).

> This non-invasive treatment is performed on a machine similar to an MRI. The subject wears a helmet that emits inaudible soundwaves that manage to reach very specific areas of the brain, as the machine is guided by real-time brain images. Prior to this, lipid-shelled microbubbles are administered, and these are activated inside the blood vessel when they come into contact with the soundwaves, opening a crack a few millimeters wide in the BBB — which is big enough for the desired drug to slip through.

> Researchers tested this technique on monkeys, and found that they can open the brain barrier for about 24 hours and introduce deactivated adenoviruses, which are commonly used for gene therapy, in which gene treatments are delivered directly to the target area. No apparent side effects were reported. The study, which was published in Science Advances, also reported that this same technology was also able to temporarily deactivate the BBB of three Parkinson’s patients, in the exact part of their brain that was being targeted.

---

> Until now, experimental gene therapies had to be delivered to Parkinson’s patients directly into the brain, which involved piercing the skull with needles to bypass the blood-brain barrier. The new LIFU technique opens up the possibility of delivering gene therapy without surgery or serious side effects."

“Our reliance on each other for help is constant,” said Professor Nick Enfield, of University of Sydney, who led the study with Assistant Professor Giovanni Rossi of University of California, Los Angeles.

The study found that in everyday life, someone will signal a need for assistance (for example, to pass a utensil) once every two minutes and 17 seconds on average. In all cultures, these small requests for assistance are complied with seven times more often than they are declined.

“On the rare occasions when people do decline, they explain why,” said Professor Enfield. “This human tendency to help others when needed—and to explain when such help can’t be given—transcends other cultural differences.

While humans undoubtedly possess both altruistic and selfish tendencies, it is crucial to recognize that these behaviors are not mutually exclusive. Indeed, the prevalence of cooperation and assistance observed across diverse cultures indicates that the innate drive to help others is a fundamental aspect of human nature.  
  
The argument that certain selfish behaviors are essential for individual or societal success might be seen as an attempt to justify actions that prioritize personal gain over the collective good. Such claims could be interpreted as apologetics for sociopathic tendencies, which do not accurately reflect the complex balance of traits that make up human nature.  
  
Early human development provides an excellent example of the innate drive for altruistic behavior. Babies and young children often exhibit a strong inclination to soothe, comfort, and share with others, highlighting the inherent cooperative tendencies that are present from an early age. While selfish behaviors, such as those observed in greedy toddlers, do emerge later in development, it is essential to recognize that both cooperative and self-interested traits coexist within individuals.  
  
In conclusion, the recent research on human cooperation adds valuable insights to the ongoing debate surrounding human nature and its balance of selfish and altruistic tendencies. The study's findings reinforce the idea that cooperation and assistance are deeply ingrained in human behavior across diverse cultures, providing a compelling counterpoint to the notion that selfishness is the primary driving force behind human actions. It is crucial to acknowledge and appreciate the complexity of human nature and the interplay of various traits that shape our behaviors and interactions with others."

Rooted in the novel and the mysterious, awe is a common experience in childhood, but research is almost silent with respect to the import of this emotion for children. Awe makes individuals feel small, thereby shifting their attention to the social world. Here, we studied the effects of art-elicited awe on children’s prosocial behavior toward an out-group and its unique physiological correlates. In two preregistered studies (Study 1: N = 159, Study 2: N = 353), children between 8 and 13 years old viewed movie clips that elicited awe, joy, or a neutral (control) response. Children who watched the awe-eliciting clip were more likely to spend their time on an effortful task (Study 1) and to donate their experimental earnings (Studies 1 and 2), all toward benefiting refugees. They also exhibited increased respiratory sinus arrhythmia, an index of parasympathetic nervous system activation associated with social engagement. We discuss implications for fostering prosociality by reimagining children’s environments to inspire awe at a critical age."

Many type 1s were sick with a virus in the 2 weeks before they were diagnosed (including our son) and I would imagine this could be more likely with a novel virus due to excessive immune activity.

A recent study suggests that up to one in 20 new diabetes cases could be linked to Covid-19.  
  
The study, published in the journal Diabetes, Obesity and Metabolism, analyzed data from more than 3 million individuals in the United States. The researchers found that people who had been infected with Covid-19 were more likely to develop diabetes within six months than those who had not been infected. The risk of developing diabetes was highest in people who had been hospitalized with Covid-19 and those with severe Covid-19 infections.  
  
The study adds to a growing body of research suggesting a link between Covid-19 and diabetes. Other studies have found that people with diabetes are more likely to have severe Covid-19 infections and are at increased risk of dying from Covid-19.  
  
The exact mechanisms underlying the link between Covid-19 and diabetes are not yet fully understood. It is possible that Covid-19 may cause inflammation and damage to the pancreas, the organ responsible for producing insulin. Additionally, the stress of a severe illness like Covid-19 may trigger the development of diabetes in people who are predisposed to the condition.  
  
Overall, these findings underscore the importance of diabetes prevention and management during the Covid-19 pandemic. People with diabetes should take extra precautions to avoid Covid-19 infection, while healthcare providers should be vigilant for signs of diabetes in people who have had Covid-19.

Then the hormones act as ligands that dictate the expression and activity of enzymes. The enzymes have their own energy-constrained limits on their kinetics too (I’m including transport proteins under this description of “enzymes”). The process uses energy and creates energy. 

Energy feeds back into regulation, and regulation feeds back into energy. Aren’t these “conflicting models” just rate limited, continuous, sequences?"

Paving over gardens and using plastic grass has become a trend in recent years, which contributes to rising urban temperatures and biodiversity decline.

Now, research from the University of Sheffield has suggested policymakers should offer incentives such as council tax or water bill discounts to encourage gardeners to use environmentally sensitive techniques to help combat climate breakdown and boost communities’ health and wellbeing.

Prof Ross Cameron, an expert in landscape horticulture at the University of Sheffield and the author of the paper published in the journal Urban Forestry and Urban Greening, suggests financial incentives should be given to gardeners who ensure the area around their home is well-stocked with plants.

Cameron said: “Gardens account for a third of all our urban areas and are vital spaces in terms of keeping our buildings and city environments cool in summer, absorbing rain to avoid flash flooding and providing an important refuge for wildlife.

“Gardens need to be green and full of plants to be beneficial to the local environment, and some types of garden are more beneficial than others.”

“The paradox is that many gardens are not actually green and some trends in garden design can be very damaging for the urban environment. We have paved them over to house the car, or provide sterile patio space; factors that increase urban temperatures and increase flooding risk.”

I now live an hour from London in an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty & and Area of Special Scientific Interest.  It's 3 miles of farmland and fields to the nearest town, 5 miles in the opposite direction to the next nearest.  My ""garden"" is.... hold on, let me check the blueprints... 12 m\^2.

If you want eco-friendly gardeners, they need to be able to own some land worth gardening.  Or you could try building some damn houses so people aren't overcrowded into flats that share a tiny strip of dog-turd-strewn grass to comply with planning permissions.

This house, 12m\^2.  Built in the 1960's.

My previous rental... 1990's build.  ZERO.  A strip of ""shared"" managed lawn between every flat that we weren't even allowed to sit out on, let alone use as a garden.

House before that, worth about three times as much, about 40m\^2.  Built in the 1930's.

Flat before that, 1990's build.  Nothing.  A tarmac yard about 10m\^2.

Notice the trend of build date versus garden size?

Garden space is a luxury few can afford nowadays.

And my council tax is still based on an expected occupancy generated by an evaluation last done in the 80's?  My water bill was based on my council tax band.  I got a water meter put in and immediately slashed my water bill by 90% once it reflected what I actually used, rather than what someone last valued my house as 50 years before I even bought it, and then scaled for inflation.

You want to incentivise me?  Let me own some land attached to my house.

Ironically I'm planning on paving over my ""garden"" so I can at least sit out in something that isn't just a muddy stony patch of weeds unable to sustain a lawn (and certainly not worth owning a lawnmower for).  Then I plan to put raised beds in to restore a bit of greenery in a way that it'll stay there."
1188,High-Intensity interval training reduces transcriptomic age: A randomized controlled trial (Apr 2023),26,science,12tbtbc,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/acel.13841,6,"
Abstract:
>While the relationship between exercise and life span is well-documented, little is known about the effects of specific exercise protocols on modern measures of biological age. Transcriptomic age (TA) predictors provide an opportunity to test the effects of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) on biological age utilizing whole-genome expression data. A single-site, single-blinded, randomized controlled clinical trial design was utilized. Thirty sedentary participants (aged 40–65) were assigned to either a HIIT group or a no-exercise control group. After collecting baseline measures, HIIT participants performed three 10 × 1 HIIT sessions per week for 4 weeks. Each session lasted 23 min, and total exercise duration was 276 min over the course of the 1-month exercise protocol. TA, PSS-10 score, PSQI score, PHQ-9 score, and various measures of body composition were all measured at baseline and again following the conclusion of exercise/control protocols. Transcriptomic age reduction of 3.59 years was observed in the exercise group while a 3.29-years increase was observed in the control group. Also, PHQ-9, PSQI, BMI, body fat mass, and visceral fat measures were all improved in the exercise group. A hypothesis-generation gene expression analysis suggested exercise may modify autophagy, mTOR, AMPK, PI3K, neurotrophin signaling, insulin signaling, and other age-related pathways. A low dose of HIIT can reduce an mRNA-based measure of biological age in sedentary adults between the ages of 40 and 65 years old. Other changes in gene expression were relatively modest, which may indicate a focal effect of exercise on age-related biological processes."

[Bee breweries: The unusually fermentative, lactobacilli-dominated brood cell microbiomes of cellophane bees](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2023.1114849/full)

Abstract:

>Pathogens and parasites of solitary bees have been studied for decades, but the microbiome as a whole is poorly understood for most taxa. Comparative analyses of microbiome features such as composition, abundance, and specificity, can shed light on bee ecology and the evolution of host–microbe interactions. Here we study microbiomes of ground-nesting cellophane bees (Colletidae: Diphaglossinae). From a microbial point of view, the diphaglossine genus Ptiloglossa is particularly remarkable: their larval provisions are liquid and smell consistently of fermentation. We sampled larval provisions and various life stages from wild nests of Ptiloglossa arizonensis and two species of closely related genera: Caupolicana yarrowi and Crawfordapis luctuosa. We also sampled nectar collected by P. arizonensis. Using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, we find that larval provisions of all three bee species are near-monocultures of lactobacilli. Nectar communities are more diverse, suggesting ecological filtering. Shotgun metagenomic and phylogenetic data indicate that Ptiloglossa culture multiple species and strains of Apilactobacillus, which circulate among bees and flowers. Larval lactobacilli disappear before pupation, and hence are likely not vertically transmitted, but rather reacquired from flowers as adults. Thus, brood cell microbiomes are qualitatively similar between diphaglossine bees and other solitary bees: lactobacilli-dominated, environmentally acquired, and non-species-specific. However, shotgun metagenomes provide evidence of a shift in bacterial abundance. As compared with several other bee species, Ptiloglossa have much higher ratios of bacterial to plant biomass in larval provisions, matching the unusually fermentative smell of their brood cells. Overall, Ptiloglossa illustrate a path by which hosts can evolve quantitatively novel symbioses: not by acquiring or domesticating novel symbionts, but by altering the microenvironment to favor growth of already widespread and generalist microbes."

The socialisation aspect of this observation is the more interesting of the findings for me. That these creatures use necessary tasks as an opportunity to socialise and bond is incredibly interesting. I wonder how common this kind of behaviour is within this species, and how common it might be with other cetaceans.

Annoyingly, the article mentions the research journal but doesn't link to the relevant article directly.

[Exfoliating Whales–Sandy Bottom Contact Behaviour of Humpback Whales](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-1312/11/3/600)

&#x200B;

>Abstract  
>  
>Cetaceans are known for their intelligence and display of complex behaviours including object use. For example, bowhead whales (Balaena mysticetus) are known to rub on rocks and some humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) populations undertake lateral bottom feeding. Such underwater behaviour is difficult to observe but can play a critical role in the whales’ survival and well-being. Distinguishing social behaviours from those which serve a specific function remains challenging due to a lack of direct observations and detailed descriptions of such behaviours. A CATS (Customized Animal Tracking Solutions) suction cup tag with on board video and a 3D inertial measurement unit was deployed on three different humpback whales to assess their behaviour in the Gold Coast bay, Australia. Here, we present evidence of humpback whales (tagged and untagged individuals) performing bottom contact with prolonged rolling on sandy substrate. In addition, we showed that fish were actively feeding from the whales’ skin during this behaviour. We detail the behaviour and discuss possible drivers, with a focus on cetacean innovation, possible ectoparasite removal, and habitat preferences."

Specifically those born female and being diagnosed or claiming gender dysphoria now increased so drastically they don't know what to do. So any study would first have to establish the capacity to baseline results of that much enlarged group which is entirely new so there would be no way to baseline it using a study that references past groups of young people. 

The reality of these studies is that they are inherently dealing with a moving target because of the increase in people being ""diagnosed"" and changes in how these people are treated throughout any treatment they are receiving. From a purely scientific basis this is a complicated issue to try and study.

What is not helpful is the politics and the people deciding they already know the answer. The best answer we have is still social acceptance first and foremost. The ability to effectively identify children who would benefit from hormone treatment is still far harder to know."

Have there been any studies following the use of GnRH analogs in children that aren't experiencing gender dysphoria, and what are the long-term physical outcomes that were/are for those children? For instance, delaying the early onset of menarche because a child is 5 or 6 years old and showing physical signs of precocious puberty.  


I wonder if studies like that can be brought into the conversation to help with the data pool. I'm sure there are positive benefits psychologically in delaying puberty in those instances. Or is that too far off from the question they are trying to answer and isn't easily applicable?"

The new findings have been published in [Psychiatry Research](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2023.115133).

Ketamine therapy is a type of treatment for depression that involves the use of ketamine, an anesthetic drug that has been found to have antidepressant properties. The therapy typically involves a series of intravenous (IV) infusions of ketamine in a clinical setting, under the supervision of a trained healthcare provider.

Ketamine works differently than traditional antidepressant medications, which usually target serotonin or other neurotransmitters in the brain. Instead, ketamine acts on a different neurotransmitter called glutamate, which is involved in communication between brain cells.

Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a mental health condition that affects how a person thinks, feels, and behaves. People with BPD often have difficulty regulating their emotions and experience intense mood swings, which can lead to impulsive behavior and strained relationships.

BPD often coexists with major depressive disorder. When BPD and depression are present together, the depression tends to be more severe and resistant to treatment. Even with available treatments like antidepressants and psychotherapy, people with BPD often have poorer outcomes than those without BPD. Unfortunately, there is currently no FDA-approved treatment specifically for depressed individuals with comorbid BPD.

“This analysis was directly inspired by my experience treating patients with depression with comorbid borderline personality,” said study author Joshua D. Rosenblat, a psychiatrist and the medical director of Braxia Health and an assistant professor at the University of Toronto."

I put on an eye mask, took the lozenges, held them for 15 minutes, then put on noise canceling headphones that played classical music. I started to melt into the couch and had lots of thoughts, feelings, and images come at me. It was honesty like being black out drunk, I straight up don't remember an hour of it. I came out of it with my therapist holding my hand reminding me I'm in her office. 

The experience was honestly kind of a nightmare, I literally thought that I was in some Truman Show type experience, it was an endless loop and I didn't think I would snap out of it. I felt nauseous afterwards, like a hangover and went home and napped for almost 2 hours. The next day I felt great, a week later I'm perfectly fine. The amount of sessions will depend but I'm very optimistic about how I will turn out. It still involves therapy and working on your self, and more sessions that will be less intense.

>The article discusses how melanocyte stem cells (McSCs) in the hair follicle maintain their homeostasis by undergoing a process called dedifferentiation. Dedifferentiation is a process by which a more differentiated cell reverts to a less differentiated state. In the case of McSCs, dedifferentiation allows them to self-renew and replenish their population.

>The researchers found that McSCs undergo dedifferentiation in response to a number of factors, including stress, inflammation, and DNA damage. Dedifferentiation is initiated by a process called p63 signaling. p63 is a transcription factor that regulates the expression of genes involved in cell differentiation. When p63 signaling is activated, it causes McSCs to downregulate genes involved in differentiation and upregulate genes involved in self-renewal.

>The researchers also found that dedifferentiation is essential for the maintenance of McSCs in the hair follicle. McSCs that are unable to undergo dedifferentiation eventually die. This suggests that dedifferentiation is a critical process for the long-term survival of McSCs.

>The researchers are hopeful that this discovery could lead to new treatments for hair loss. They are currently developing drugs that could target p63 signaling and promote dedifferentiation in McSCs."

These findings contrast with epidemiological data.",767,science,12s9mww,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/pcn.13555,96,"Abstract  
Aims  
Evidence for case-control studies suggests that cannabis use is a risk factor for the development of psychosis. However, there have been limited prospective studies and the direction of this association remains controversial. The primary aim of the present study was to examine the association between cannabis use and the incidence of psychotic disorders in people at clinical high risk of psychosis. Secondary aims were to assess associations between cannabis use and the persistence of psychotic symptoms, and with functional outcome.  
  
Methods  
Current and previous cannabis use were assessed in individuals at clinical high risk of psychosis (n=334) and healthy controls (n=67), using a modified version of the Cannabis Experience Questionnaire. Participants were assessed at baseline and followed up for 2 years. Transition to psychosis and persistence of psychotic symptoms were assessed using the Comprehensive Assessment of At-Risk Mental States criteria. Level of functioning at follow up was assessed using the Global Assessment of Functioning disability scale.  
  
Results  
During follow up, 16.2% of the clinical high-risk sample developed psychosis. Of those who did not become psychotic, 51.4% had persistent symptoms and 48.6% were in remission. There was no significant association between any measure of cannabis use at baseline and either transition to psychosis, the persistence of symptoms, or functional outcome.  
  
Conclusions  
These findings contrast with epidemiological data that suggest that cannabis use increases the risk of psychotic disorder."

According to data, people of color have been disproportionately impacted by COVID-19 in prisons and jails, which are often overcrowded and lack adequate healthcare resources.  
  
Black and Latino individuals are more likely to be incarcerated than white individuals, and they are also more likely to have underlying health conditions that put them at higher risk for severe illness or death from COVID-19. This has led to a higher rate of COVID-19 infections and deaths in prisons and jails among people of color.  
  
In addition, COVID-19 has disrupted court proceedings and has led to a backlog of cases, which has disproportionately affected people of color who are already overrepresented in the criminal legal system. This has resulted in longer pretrial detention times, increased exposure to COVID-19, and a higher likelihood of being sentenced to prison or jail.  
  
Furthermore, COVID-19 has also highlighted the racial disparities in law enforcement practices. Black and Latino individuals are more likely to be stopped, searched, and arrested by law enforcement, which puts them at higher risk of exposure to COVID-19.  
  
Overall, the COVID-19 pandemic has brought to light the deep-rooted racial disparities in the US criminal legal system and the urgent need for systemic change. It is critical to address these disparities in order to ensure equal access to healthcare, fair treatment in the criminal legal system, and protection of human rights for all individuals, regardless of race.

The association between witnessing firearm-involved violence and firearm carriage among teens, independent of non-firearm involved violence, has yet to be identified. The present analyses estimate associations of witnessing firearm-involved violence and non-firearm involved violence with firearm carriage in a nationally representative sample of teens. Data are from the FACTS National Survey—a cross-sectional web-based survey of 2140 US teenagers (ages 14–18) fielded in June–July 2020. The team first estimated the correlation between witnessing firearm-involved and non-firearm involved violence. Bivariate and multivariable logistic regression then assessed the associations of witnessing firearm-involved and non-firearm involved violence with firearm carriage. The team pooled results over fifteen imputed datasets to account for missing data, and analyses incorporated survey weights to create nationally representative estimates. The correlation between witnessing firearm-involved and non-firearm involved violence was low (ϕ = 0.19\[0.15, 0.23\]). Witnessing firearm-involved violence and witnessing non-firearm involved violence were both associated with teen firearm carriage in bivariate models (OR: 3.55\[1.86, 6.79\]; 4.51\[1.75, 11.6\]). These associations persisted in the multivariable model that adjusted for violence victimization, demographic characteristics, and both witnessing firearm-involved and non-firearm involved violence (aOR for witnessing firearm-involved violence = 3.67\[1.77, 7.59\]; aOR for witnessing non-firearm involved violence = 4.30\[1.56, 11.9\]). We found no difference in the strength of these associations (Wald χ2(df = 1) = 0.25, p = 0.80). Results suggest that witnessing firearm-involved and non-firearm involved violence are uniquely associated with teens' firearm carriage. Identifying means to reduce both exposures, in addition to recognizing factors that may weaken the associations between witnessing different types of violence and firearm carriage, may disrupt cycles of violence."

Objective  
The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that perfluorinated alkylate substance (PFAS) exposures are associated with body weight increases in a dietary intervention study.  
  
Methods  
In the DioGenes trial, adults with obesity first lost at least 8% of their body weight and then completed at least 26 weeks on a specific diet. Concentrations of five major PFASs were assessed in plasma samples from study baseline.  
  
Results  
In 381 participants with complete data, plasma concentrations averaged 2.9 ng/mL and 1.0 ng/mL for perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorohexanesulfonic acid (PFHxS), respectively. A doubling in plasma PFOA was associated with an increase in weight at 26 weeks by 1.50 kg (95% CI: 0.88–2.11), with an increase of 0.91 kg (95% CI: 0.54–1.27) for PFHxS, independent of diet groups and sex. Associations for other PFASs were in the same direction and significant, although not after adjustment for PFOA and PFHxS. Weight changes associated with elevated PFAS exposures were similar to or larger than average changes ascribed to the different diet groups.  
  
Conclusions  
Elevated plasma concentrations of PFOA and PFHxS were associated with increased weight gain that exceeded those related to the diets. Obesogenic PFASs may cause weight gain and thus contribute to the obesity pandemic."

If a country could mandate that all disposable packaging should be made from cardboard, cellulose (because people like windows) or bio-plastics, then it really doesn't matter if everything goes into the same waste stream. Trees and other biomass are grown, absorbing co2. They harvested and processed, paid for by the fact that people want packaging. After the function of packaging is fulfilled, it's effectively a free fuel source, displacing fossil fuels. All the waste can be gassified (to mostly hydrogen) to generate electricity or heat, leaving behind solid carbon char. Bury that char in the ground to sequester the carbon and the whole wood->packaging->fuel process becomes carbon negative. Turn part of the problem into part of the solution."

>Evidence from 50 studies in 17 countries indicates that social media usage leads to body image concerns, eating disorders/disordered eating and poor mental health via the mediating pathways of social comparison, thin / fit ideal internalisation, and self-objectification. 

>Specific exposures (social media trends, pro-eating disorder content, appearance focused platforms and investment in photos) and moderators (high BMI, female gender, and pre-existing body image concerns) strengthen the relationship, while other moderators (high social media literacy and body appreciation) are protective, hinting at a ‘self-perpetuating cycle of risk’.

>[...]

>Further to this, evidence suggests that social media literacy amongst the young is low, and clinical recognition of eating disorder symptomatology and online risk factors poor [106]. 

>In parallel, social media has been described as more addictive than alcohol and cigarettes, body image dissatisfaction and eating disorder pathology are on the rise, and the mental health of today’s youth is declining [98].

I see skinny young teens examining themselves in the mirror repeatedly between sets as though they expect to be more muscular than they were a few minutes before.  They take selfies in the locker room between exercises. 

This age group also avoids completely disrobing in front of others like the plague.  When they need to, they wrap a towel around themselves like a skirt and awkwardly pull their underwear off or on beneath it.  Few use the showers at all.

This is a huge change in gym and locker room behavior during my lifetime (M72).  In my high school, there were only gang showers and everyone was required to shower after gym class.  I never once saw anyone take a photo of themselves or anyone else in the locker room or the gym, nor at private gyms in that era.  People entering competitions were the only ones practicing poses and flexing in front of a mirror.  Mirrors were there to monitor form while exercising.

It’s great that so many more young people are into health and fitness now.  This is reflected in the vast increase in gyms, both in number and size.  My large, state university had only a single basement classroom with weights and Universal machines for the entire school (unless you were on a team, for which where were better facilities). 

My sense is that body image concerns have as much to do with the increase in gym use as knowledge and pursuit of health and fitness benefits."

Additionally, people with eating disorders may seek more social validation, which can translate to more time on Social Media. This is correlative, not causal."

Here, we examine K.I.V Steenstrups Nordre Bræ (‘Steenstrup’) in Southeast Greenland, which, between 2018 and 2021, retreated \~7 km, thinned \~20%, doubled in discharge, and accelerated \~300%. This rate of change is unprecedented amongst Greenland’s glaciers and now places Steenstrup in the top 10% of glaciers by contribution to ice-sheet-wide discharge. In contrast to expected behaviour from a shallow, grounded tidewater glacier, Steenstrup was insensitive to high surface temperatures that destabilised many regional glaciers in 2016, appearing instead to respond to a >2 °C anomaly in deeper Atlantic water (AW) in 2018. By 2021, a rigid proglacial mélange had developed alongside notable seasonal variability. Steenstrup’s behaviour highlights that even long-term stable glaciers with high sills are vulnerable to sudden and rapid retreat from warm AW intrusion."

""Most patients were initially certified for a 1:1 (∆9-tetrahydrocannabinol:cannabidiol) tincture. Eight-seven percent of patients (n = 60) were noted to exhibit an improvement in any PD symptom after starting MC (medical cannabis). Symptoms with the highest incidence of improvement included cramping/dystonia, pain, spasticity, lack of appetite, dyskinesia, and tremor. After starting MC, 56% of opioid users (n = 14) were able to decrease or discontinue opioid use with an average daily morphine milligram equivalent change from 31 at baseline to 22 at the last follow-up visit. The MC was well-tolerated with no severe AEs (adverse events) reported and low rate of MC discontinuation due to AEs (n = 4).""

Dr Eger and their team have analysed the contribution of kelp forests to ecosystem services using fish and invertebrate surveys and measures of annual net primary production – or growth. This growth requires elements such as carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus to be pulled out of the seawater, effectively cleaning the water and contributing to carbon sequestration.

The team found the most significant economic value of kelp forests in fisheries production and uptake of nitrogen, contributing an average of $29,000 and $73,000 per hectare, respectively, annually. While the estimation for carbon sequestration was low ($163 per ha annually) ecologically, it was comparable to seagrass meadows and terrestrial forests.

Dr Eger is hopeful the research will help start more conversations about the role of kelp forests and the importance of their conservation.

INTRODUCTION  
Six million Americans live with Alzheimer's disease and Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (AD/ADRD), a major health-care cost driver. We evaluated the cost effectiveness of non-pharmacologic interventions that reduce nursing home admissions for people living with AD/ADRD.  
  
METHODS  
We used a person-level microsimulation to model the hazard ratios (HR) on nursing home admission for four evidence-based interventions compared to usual care: Maximizing Independence at Home (MIND), NYU Caregiver (NYU); Alzheimer's and Dementia Care (ADC); and Adult Day Service Plus (ADS Plus). We evaluated societal costs, quality-adjusted life years and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios.  
  
RESULTS  
All four interventions cost less and are more effective (i.e., cost savings) than usual care from a societal perspective. Results did not materially change in 1-way, 2-way, structural, and probabilistic sensitivity analyses.  
  
CONCLUSION  
Dementia-care interventions that reduce nursing home admissions save societal costs compared to usual care. Policies should incentivize providers and health systems to implement non-pharmacologic interventions."

I look at this picture and I see someone in desperate need of a companion. Not some one night stand, not some shallow sexual advance, but an actual friend. But people suck and the world is loud and scary. So once again this person has been up all night. At night the world is asleep; quiet and peaceful. At night this person feels free to be themselves without judging eyes. They spend the night riding that wave of freedom, just as they have most other nights, all the while trying to ignore an old nagging feeling.

But the sun is up, the world is getting loud again, and they are sleepy. And in the final moments before drifting off they wrap an arm around themselves in one final attempt to placate that nagging touch-starved need for someone they can trust to be free and happy around.

If the label takes possession of it the family will have to fight for every inch of ownership claim.  

If the family takes possession it puts them in a MUCH stronger position.  

Either way you’re not equipped for that step, and the label will strong arm the everloving fuck out of you with legal threats and scary legal speak if they know you have it.  Don’t go there.  It’s a Pandora’s box.  Source:  been on Capitol and Virgin and know how slimy these fucks are at every given opportunity.  
 

First, Digitize it, but keep the copy on a non-internet connected device.  In my opinion you are the current steward of something very important to music, and have an obligation to preserve its integrity. 

A good family friend of mine is an entertainment lawyer.  I will text him tomorrow and see what he says your next step(s) should be.

Do not, for the love of god put that thing in another tape deck until it’s digitized.

It’s my strong opinion that the next time the tape is ran should be in a converter.

The quality will only deteriorate in analog form, and since you don’t have the masters it should be put to digital ASAP.

Make sure the estate, not the label, is the next entity to take possession.  Please"

“Love Package” sounds like a Spinal Tap album.

Maybe not least popular, but it's probably low to mid in terms of popularity. This is my favourite album of all time. It's the perfect blend of stoner rock, hard rock and in some moments, pop rock. It goes from dark and brooding to upbeat and dancing and it all feels so cohesive. A lot of Stoner Rock fans will say either Blues/Sky Valkey are the best in the genre, I'll always say this eponymous album."

For trying new and exotic foods. 

My gma has always been a big fan of Prince. Not just his music, but she paid attention to what his hometown thought of him and his behavior toward fans and kindness to others. She’s 85 now and still loves the voice that sang so many of her favorite songs, and also sang the song that inspired her to return the album Purple Rain to K mart 😅 But She repurchased it when she got over her shock. I have her copy. I was a light 8 then and she knew I’d want to listen to it, she didn’t feel right about it. But she brought it down form the top of her closet when I turned 13, figuring I had heard worse at school by then. My mother didn’t allow decile music in our home. This indulgence felt like the most exquisite rebellion. I guess my mom also contributed to my love and appreciation for not just music, but most things controversial or a little odd. 
If there is an afterlife, I hope gma gets to talk Prince’s ear off for all of eternity."

1757,Can somebody with theory knowledge dissect/explain what victor Wooten does here . It’s incredible,2,Music,12vw8fj,https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMYcLbKtn/,3,"He’s basically just playing chords on the bass, like a piano might. The guitar is playing a riff that just goes E E D E, which is implying something like an E minor or E myxlodian sound. Very common funk stuff.

Behind that riff he plays a VI (Cmaj) chord to VII (Dmaj) chord, which still makes sense in E minor. It might sound a little less expected because funk tends to use a dorian sound (C# instead of the C here). He also voices those chords interestingly to have a bit more color. I think it’s C G D to D A D. So they’re missing the third, but the guitar kind of fills that in. You could argue the D is a sus chord, but basically, C major to D major.

Then he gets a little weirder. Ebmaj7 to Fmaj6. Still two major chords a whole step apart. Again, he doesn’t play every note in those chords, but that’s what is implied. The guitar E and D sound just fine over Fmaj6 (F A C D). It ventures outside of E minor, but it doesn’t clash with the E and D. The Ebmaj7 (Eb G Bb D) clashes pretty hard with the E in the guitar though.

Buuuuut that’s kind of the point of what he was saying about using his ear. He started with the theory part, but that Ebmaj7 was probably just by ear. On paper, it might not seem “correct”, but it works here because that guitar riff is repetitive (you could call it an ostinato if you want to get fancy), and the bass is just overriding the harmony however he wants.

Then he goes B B B B B, which is the V of our home key of E, taking you back home.

Hope that makes some amount of sense. I need to go the fuck to sleep."

Otherwise it may play poorly even when you're doing things right.  If you don't know how you can pay a guitar store person to do it.

There are lots of lessons on YouTube, but I haven't really evaluated the beginning lessons to be able to recommend any.  You'll probably start with tuning the guitar, followed by chords, scales, and some good beginner songs to learn.

Whether or not you want learn to read standard sheet music is up to you.  Many guitarists don't, but it's a good skill to have.  If you do then a teacher would be a good idea."

In child psychology, armless drawings might be signs of a timid nature. If armless drawings are often, there is chance they point to abuse. Being armless, legless, mouthless assigns helplessness and the nature of abuse. Private parts and armless drawings are alarming to me.

This could be a random goofy drawing. If so, please take away some knowledge that might help ID abuse, especially if you're in early education. It never hurts to ask why the pictures are drawn in the way they are."

Different cultures have different cultural mores for what’s acceptable.

Also, you’ve already been corrected on this, but this is a film by the late Isao Takahata, not Hayao Miyazaki.

Now I can't attest to it's accuracy, but it was just one of quite a few stories he told of his encounters with the US Navy and he swears it's true. He wasn't one to make shit up, so I'm willing to believe it. 

In any case, My friend Dave was on a ship doing joint activities out in the middle of nowhere on some tiny island. Americans on one side. British on the other. The idea was to take the island. They had blanks and were supposed to call a hit when they fired. About halfway through the day, they ran out of blanks. Hunkered down on either side of a ridge, Dave and his mates, with nothing to fight with, started hurling rocks, sticks and basically whatever they could get airborne over the ridge. A young American voice called out ""Sarge! They're throwing rocks at us. What should we do?"" to which a booming voice returned ""Throw 'em back you fuck!""  

True or not. I like this story."

Why is it always gone? Blue Jays. The crafty birds stay hidden and watch the crows hide the food. When the crows fly off to bury more or fly away to come back later, the Jay swoop down, dig it up, and take it away.

Edit: I even have two feeders (front and back yard) that I fill with seed for the Jays (and others) but they prefer stealing from the crows."

I love how companies used COVID as an excuse for poor performance in 2020-2021 and then turn around and blame recovery from COVID as an excuse of poor performance in 2022. Read their financials: they were struggling before COVID and said they were transforming the company in 2020-2022 because previous leadership had poor operations. Then they had better profit in 2020, because stores were closed (stores had 20% declines in revenue but they saved on labor and store infrastructure) and focused on online sales- so they went a massive stock repurchasing plan. Then in 2021 they said their supply chain issues and inventory availability hurt online sales and profit, but they continued with massive stock repurchasing. Now they're saying people are spending money on traveling and eating at restaurants, and that's why they're bankrupt."

The wreck of the Montevideo Maru was located after a 12-day search at a depth of over 4000 meter (13,120 feet) — deeper than the Titanic — off Luzon island in the South China Sea, using an autonomous underwater vehicle with in-built sonar.

There will be no efforts to remove artifacts or human remains out of respect for the families of those who died, said a statement Saturday from the Sydney-based Silentworld Foundation, a not-for-profit dedicated to maritime archaeology and history. It took part in the mission together with Dutch deep-sea survey specialists Fugro and Australia's Defense Department.

""The extraordinary effort behind this discovery speaks for the enduring truth of Australia's solemn national promise to always remember and honour those who served our country,"" Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said. ""This is the heart and the spirit of Lest We Forget.""
The Montevideo Maru was transporting prisoners and civilians who were captured after the fall of Rabaul in Papua New Guinea. The ship was not marked as carrying POWs, and on July 1, 1942, the American submarine Sturgeon, after stalking the ship through the night, fired four torpedoes, which found their target, sinking the vessel in less than 10 minutes.
Those killed included 1,080 people from 14 nations, including 979 Australians""

Fun bit of history this evening."

**30 June 1942:** Patrolling northwest of Bojeador as before. Dove at dawn, surfaced at dusk. At 2216 sighted a darkened ship to southward. At first, due to bearing on which sighted, believed him to be on northernly course, but after a few minutes observation it was evident he was on a westerly course, and going at high speed. He quite evidently had stood out of Babuyan Channel, headed for Hainan. Put on all engines and worked up to full power, proceeding westward in attempt to get ahead of him. For an hour and a half we couldn't make a nickel. This fellow was really going, making at least 17 knots, and probably a bit more, as he appeared to be zig-zagging. At this time it looked a bit hopeless, but determined to hang on in the hope he would slow or change course towards us. His range at this time was estimated at around 18,000 yards. Sure enough, about midnight he slowed to about 12 knots. After that it was okay. 

**1 July 1942:** Proceeding to intercept target as before. Altered course to gain position ahead of him, and dove at 0146. When he got in periscope range,  it could be seen that he was larger than first believed, also that his course was a little to the left of west, leaving us some 5,000 yards off the track. Was able to close some 1,000 yards of this, and then turned to fire stern tubes:

1. Only 3 tubes available forward, and at this range and with large target 4 fish spread desirable.

2. After tubes had 700 lbs heads, while heads forward were small ones.

At 0225 fired four-torpedo spread, range 4,000 yards, from after tubes. At 0229 heard and observed explosion about 75-100 feet abaft of stack. At 0240 observed ship sink stern-first. 0250 surfaced, proceeded eastward, completing battery charge. Ship believed to be *Rio de Janeiro Maru*, or very similar type, although it is possible it was a larger ship; he was a big one. A few lights were observed on deck just after the explosion, but there was apparently no power available, and his bow was well up in the air in 6 minutes. Dove at dawn. No further contacts. 

Again the advantage of a straight shot was demonstrated. I can honestly say that, even at the long range at which these torpedoes were fired, every one felt perfectly conficent, at the instant of firing, that we would hit. In fact, immediately after firing, I turned with full rudder in order to bring the bow tubes to bear in case of a miss. The T.D.C. operator (Lt. Nimitz) remarked as the torpedoes were still running, ""We won't have to use any more. One of those will get him."" *[Lt. Nimitz had an unusual amount of confidence in 1942 American torpedoes]*

It was also noted (As it was also on 25 June) that at least some of the torpedoes that miss explode as they sink. Two were heard about six minutes after firing. It would seem that explosion occurs, however, before the torpedo reaches the bottom, as water was very deep. It may occur as the head crushes. Torpedoes were heard running by sound operator. Sketch of pursuit is included as enclosure (A2).

---

*Montevideo Maru* was what was known as a Hell Ship, Japanese ships used to transport POWs and slave laborers. As the name implies, conditions aboard these ships were hellish. Prisoners were packed so tightly into the ships' sweltering cargo holds that it was standing room only, had little access to food or water, and no sanitation to speak of. Delirium and death were very common."

The cause of cattle mutilation has been a topic of debate for many years. This report aims to provide an overview of the possible causes of cattle mutilation.

## Natural Causes
According to investigations by the Federal Bureau of Investigations and independent experiments, almost all of the known cases of cattle mutilation appear to have natural causes. Most of the cases involved animals that died of diseases and then were scavenged by birds and insects, which lead to the lack of tracks. To test this theory, an Arkansas sheriff placed a dead cow in a field and observed the effects of decomposition. It was found that the lack of blood was the result of livor mortis, wherein blood is no longer circulating and pools into lower areas, first draining away from the soft tissues that are most often found mutilated. Insects, particularly blowflies, can quickly eat through soft tissue, and parts such as cheeks and eyes are particular favorites of scavenging birds like crows. The experiment showed that within 48 hours, the dead cow showed many of the common signs of mutilated cattle [[1](https://beardedbutchers.com/blogs/news/what-you-need-to-know-about-cattle-mutilation)].

## Human Intervention
It is alternatively hypothesized that cattle mutilations are the result of two unrelated deviant phenomena. The bulk of mutilations are the result of predation and other natural processes, and those with anomalies that cannot be explained in this way are the work of humans who derive pleasure or sexual stimulation from mutilating animals. Human attacks against animals are a recognized phenomenon. Humans, particularly those with sociopathic disorders, have been found to have mutilated animals in elaborate ways using knives or surgical instruments. FBI records did not record the percentage of mutilated animals that fell into this category. Closely related to the deviant hypothesis is the hypothesis that cattle mutilations are the result of cult activity [[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle_mutilation)].

## Cults
Cattle mutilations are also hypothesized to be the result of cult activity. There have been many recorded cases around the world, and many convictions. Typically the victims of such attacks are cats, dogs, and other family pets, and the actions of humans are usually limited to acts of cruelty such as striking, burning, or beating animals. However, attacks have also been recorded against larger animals, including sheep, cows, and horses [[3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle_mutilation)].

## U.S. Governmental Explanation
After coming under increasing public pressure, Federal authorities launched a comprehensive investigation of the mutilation phenomenon. In May 1979, the case was passed on to the FBI, which granted jurisdiction under Title 18. The investigation was dubbed ""Operation Animal Mutilation"". The investigation was funded by a $44,170 grant (equivalent to $164,900 in 2021) from the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration, and was headed by FBI agent Kenneth Rommel [[4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle_mutilation)].

## Historical Accounts of Livestock Mutilation
The first known reports of livestock mutilation date to the 1600s when livestock were found in parts of England in similar conditions. Cattle mutilation cases hit a peak in the 1970s after hundreds of cases were reported in Colorado and New Mexico. Ranchers found the animals with what is described as “surgical” incisions, typically with 
the cheeks, udders, sex organs, and eyes removed, but without the tell-tale signs of typical predators like wolves or coyotes. Instead, the animal corpses appeared to be nearly bloodless with no tracks or indication of animals nearby [[5](https://beardedbutchers.com/blogs/news/what-you-need-to-know-about-cattle-mutilation)].

## Conclusion
Cattle mutilation is a phenomenon that has been observed among wild animals as well. The cause of cattle mutilation has been a topic of debate for many years. Investigations by the Federal Bureau of Investigations and independent experiments suggest that almost all of the known cases of cattle mutilation appear to have natural causes. However, there are also hypotheses that cattle mutilations are the result of human intervention, cults, or secretive governmental and military agencies. Further research is needed to determine the exact cause of cattle mutilation [[1](https://beardedbutchers.com/blogs/news/what-you-need-to-know-about-cattle-mutilation)][[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle_mutilation)][[3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle_mutilation)][[4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle_mutilation)][[5](https://beardedbutchers.com/blogs/news/what-you-need-to-know-about-cattle-mutilation)]."

Its not a Swastika and its not 'carved into his back' its a series of light scratches that could be construed as starting to form a swastika, but missing 2 lines to complete one.

make no mistake, fuck Nazi's, fuck anti-Semitism.  But this headline is so inflammatory and the article linked is the worst written account of this online.  The boy had a full time helper assigned by school system that was with him all day, and a support dog with him.

Not sure what happened, he may have been attacked but the special needs helper he had said he was with her the whole day and nothing happened, and the scratches on his body look like the could have happened from something other than another person intentionally scratching him, they are in no way permanent scaring injuries they are red marks with no blood except 3 small areas were the skin was broken slightly but would not be permanent scaring. One of the tiny areas were skin was broken is far off to the side not part of the scratches that could be called a possible partial swastika.

the mark could literally have been made by a small thing sticking our of a chairs back, sitting and getting a vertical scratch then getting a second scratch the is in a z shape on top of the first scratch from shifting around in the chair.  I have gotten worse scratches that I did not notice till later doing random things in the garage or yard.

I hope it wasn't a case of the boy being attacked, so maybe I am biased, you be the judge there is an image of the scratches on the link provided."

2735,Andrew Tate: House arrest extended another 30 days,36207,news,12u7lf1,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-65351270,1784,"Full Article:

Controversial influencer Andrew Tate has had his house arrest extended for another 30 days by a Romanian court.

He was first arrested alongside his brother, Tristan, at their Bucharest home in December 2022.

On 31 March, he was moved from custody to house arrest following a ruling by a Romanian judge.

Charges still have not been brought against the brothers or the two Romanian associates who were arrested alongside them.

However, prosecutors are investigating the brothers for crimes of suspected human trafficking, rape and forming a criminal gang to sexually exploit women.

They have denied the allegations.

The two associates, Georgiana Naghel and Luana Radu, were also moved from prison detention into house arrest on 31 March.

All four were ordered to stay in the buildings where they live, unless they have judicial permission to leave.

It is unclear whether the other associates also had their house arrest extended on Friday.

The Tate brothers' latest extension to their house arrest means they cannot leave their homes before 29 May.

Andrew Tate has millions of followers online. His content is particularly popular among young men drawn to his hyper-macho image."

The former staffer’s allegations prompted Republican Attorney General Andrew Bailey, who was appointed in January and is running for election, to launch an investigation into the center.

A recent ground-penetrating radar survey by the city of Wilson, North Carolina, has shown that the Vick Cemetery may contain at least 4,224 graves, which is nearly three times more than the previously estimated 1,491 graves in a 1994 survey. The cemetery, which operated from 1913 until the early 1960s, was poorly maintained and condemned by the Wilson County Health Department in 1954 as ""unfit for human burial"". In 1994, all markers were removed from the cemetery and the area was graded to level.

The recent survey indicates that the cemetery is ""organized with evenly spaced graves arranged in parallel rows,"" but two intrusive modern utility lines have likely disturbed some graves. The surveyors recommend that Wilson avoids any ground disturbance within the cemetery, and if any subsurface disturbance within the cemetery is required, grave relocations will be necessary in accordance with North Carolina laws. The report also suggests that additional signage and possibly fencing be placed around the parcel perimeter to indicate that the land in the parcel is a cemetery, and that no ground disturbance may take place.

There are no surviving records of the sales of plots in the Vick Cemetery, nor any records of who was buried there. The headstones were removed about 30 years ago and were discarded, and the city-sanctioned clearing of the cemetery in 1994 was illegal. The city of Wilson plans to purchase signs and coordinate with the founder of the Lane Street Project, which has been recovering and restoring adjacent Oddfellows and Rountree cemeteries, to find appropriate language to honor those buried at Vick Cemetery."

A state attorney in Florida has apologized for a memo produced by staff in a rural county office of all-white prosecutors, advocating more severe punishments for defendants who are Hispanic. The document, which covered plea deals, was exposed by a whistleblower former employee who worked briefly for Jack Campbell, state attorney for the second judicial circuit based in Tallahassee.

The memo was part of a wider culture of racism in the prosecutor’s office that covers a six-county region heavily populated with migrant workers, Mackenzie Hayes, the whistleblower, said. Campbell said he regretted the “error” in the production of the memo, which he confirmed as genuine, and said he had disciplined the “entry level” prosecutor who wrote it.

Federal prosecutors are reportedly considering charges against Hunter Biden for three tax crimes and a gun purchase charge. The possible charges include two misdemeanor counts for failure to file taxes, a single felony count of tax evasion related to a business expense for one year of taxes, and a potential felony gun charge. Sources suggest that the FBI and IRS finished their investigation into Hunter Biden over a year ago, and there is growing frustration inside the FBI due to the delay.

The decision on whether to file charges will be made by U.S. Attorney David Weiss, who was appointed by former President Donald Trump and retained by the Biden administration to continue the investigation. The federal investigation of Hunter Biden began in 2018 as an inquiry into his international business relationships but has since narrowed down to an examination of the income he earned from those ventures and a false statement he allegedly made during the gun purchase. The IRS Criminal Investigation division, the Justice Department, the Office of the U.S. Attorney for the District of Delaware, and attorneys for Hunter Biden have declined to comment on the matter."

A woman from Bloomington, Indiana has been indicted on a federal hate crime charge in addition to attempted murder for stabbing an 18-year-old Chinese American woman on a public bus. Billie R. Davis, who is white, is accused of repeatedly stabbing the victim with a folding knife while waiting for the bus in downtown Bloomington.

The attack left the victim with seven stab wounds to the head. Davis told police that she stabbed the victim because it “would be one less person to blow up our country”. Davis has been seeking an insanity defense, and her attorney said she has a long history of severe mental illness. The attack is part of a wider trend of racially motivated harassment and assaults against Asian Americans."

We can't find an individual to blame instead of looking into how the Justice System helped create the conditions where Chauvin was allowed to run rampant over others civil rights. Once you determine root cause you can work at solutions to make sure it doesn't happen again.

The United States has announced that it will begin training Ukrainian forces on how to use and maintain Abrams tanks in the coming weeks, as it seeks to accelerate its effort to get them into the battlefield as soon as possible, according to US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin. The announcement came as defense leaders from around Europe and the world gathered in Ramstein Air Base to coordinate the delivery of weapons and other equipment to Ukraine.

A total of 31 tanks are expected to arrive at the Grafenwoehr Training Area in Germany by the end of May, and the troops will begin training a couple of weeks later. Meanwhile, Germany has signed a memorandum of understanding with Poland and Ukraine to set up a maintenance hub for Kyiv’s Leopard 2 tank fleet in Poland, near the Ukrainian border."

According to a source familiar with the case, new evidence has come to light regarding modifications made to the gun used in the 2021 shooting on the set of ""Rust"" involving actor Alec Baldwin. The modifications may have included the potential ability for the gun to discharge a bullet without the trigger being pulled, a claim previously made by Baldwin himself in an interview with CNN. The exact nature of the modifications is not clear, and investigators will be examining the weapon to determine the extent of the modifications and how they may have impacted the gun's function.

This new evidence has the potential to contradict a 2022 FBI forensics report that stated the weapon could not be fired without pulling the trigger while the gun was cocked. The charges against Baldwin have been dismissed due to ""new facts,"" but the prosecutors overseeing the case emphasized that this does not absolve him of criminal culpability, and charges may be refiled."

A shooter who killed five co-workers at a bank in Louisville, Kentucky, left two extensive notes revealing that part of his goal was to demonstrate the ease with which someone with serious mental illness could purchase an assault-style weapon in the US.

The family of the shooter, Connor Sturgeon, acknowledged his struggles with depression but claimed they had no indications he was capable of such violence. The incident left a police officer in critical condition and injured seven others.

Officials in a Florida city have canceled a gay pride parade and restricted other pride events to people 21 years and older in anticipation of Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis signing a bill meant to keep children out of drag shows.

The Pride Alliance of the Treasure Coast posted Wednesday on Facebook that the decision to change this Saturday's Pridefest events was made after multiple conversations with Port St. Lucie officials. The city is located about 50 miles north of West Palm Beach.

“We hope that everyone understands that this is definitely not what we wanted at all and are working with the city to assure our safety as well as produce a positive event,” the post said.

The Florida House sent DeSantis a bill Wednesday that bans children from adult performances, a proposal aimed at the governor’s opposition to drag shows.

The legislation, which awaits the governor's signature, would allow the state to revoke the food and beverage licenses of businesses that admit children to adult performances. The DeSantis administration has moved to pull the liquor license of a Miami hotel that hosted a Christmas drag show, alleging children were present during “lewd” displays."

They were jailed for three years and two years and seven months respectively.

Tokyo, April 21 (Jiji Press)--Japan's Ground Self-Defense Force said Friday that it has confirmed the death of Lt. Gen. Yuichi Sakamoto, 55, head of the GSDF 8th Division, in a helicopter crash off an Okinawa Prefecture island.

Sakamoto led the division covering the strategically important Nansei southwestern island chain including Okinawa. He is the first sitting GSDF lieutenant general who has died in an accident during an SDF operation.

The GSDF UH-60JA helicopter carrying Sakamoto and nine others on board disappeared from radar near Okinawa's Miyako Island during an aerial inspection of local terrain April 6.

Six bodies were found through searches in and near what appears to be the crashed chopper, which was discovered on the seabed at a depth of 106 meters.

Five of them have been recovered so far. Sakamoto is the third whose identity has been established."

To be fair though, I'm not sure how you avoid this once it starts. I live in Dallas and it happened here. I heard people were starting to panic buy, I knew there wasn't a demand issue, I still went out and filled up my tank before the lines started though. There was a shortage later that day, and I was glad I topped up. Once it starts, it doesn't matter if it's demand or supply, if you don't get gas you're not getting it for a few days at the least.

A lot went right. The interface between the launch pad and first stage was successful. The launch tower was proven to be appropriately engineered to the monumental task of surviving the launch of the world's most powerful rocket. The integrated vehicle maintained stable flight until its first stage ran out of propellant.

But something went wrong during stage separation. This is data SpaceX wouldn't have if separation was successful. The engineers are probably already looking at the data feed and comparing it to simulations, videos and pre-launch inspection records to find the cause of the failure to separate so they can fix it.

This is where we *want* to see explosions. Before people are ever onboard. They know how the vehicle will react in this scenario, and they can even start planning for crew survival in the event this ever happens during a crewed launch.

I mean we probably didn't expect them to get an actual Greek to play this role. The last time we saw Leonidas he was played by Gerard Butler. Zorba the Greek was played by Anthony Quinn, and in the most famous portrayal of Cleopatra she was played by Elizabeth Taylor.

It's not like the real Cleopatra was much closer in appearance to Liz Taylor than she was Adele James, so it doesn't seem like that big of a deal to cast Jones if they didn't mention race at all.

Former WWE wrestler Theodore Marvin DiBiase Jr., son of wrestling legend Ted DiBiase Sr., has been charged in a federal indictment for allegedly using millions of dollars intended for needy families in Mississippi for personal purchases. DiBiase Jr. faces charges including conspiracy to commit wire fraud, theft concerning programs receiving federal funds, and money laundering. 

Prosecutors claim he and others misused funds from The Emergency Food Assistance Program (TEFAP) and the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program for personal gain. After federal funds were issued to the Mississippi Department of Human Services (MDHS), sham contracts were allegedly awarded to DiBiase Jr.'s companies, Priceless Ventures LLC and Familiae Orientem LLC. DiBiase Jr. is accused of using these funds to purchase a vehicle, a boat, and make a down payment for a house. If convicted, he faces up to 20 years in prison for each wire fraud count and up to 10 years for each count of theft and money laundering.

The Group of Seven countries are considering banning almost all exports to Russia, in an extension of the sanctions regime against Moscow for its ongoing invasion of Ukraine, a Japanese government source said Friday.

Japan is set to host the G-7 summit in May in Hiroshima, western Japan, where discussions will take place on measures to expand support to Ukraine and strengthen sanctions on Russia among other key topics.

The G-7 countries have already stopped exporting a wide range of items to Russia, including products that can be used for military purposes and luxury goods. But the latest plan could expand the trade embargo to used cars, tires, cosmetic items and clothing, the source said.

The May 19-21 summit brings together leaders of Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States, plus the European Union.

Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida has invited Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to join the gathering online."

On a separate note, could news organizations stop reporting initial police reports as facts without collaboration? So many times we hear initial police statements that paint the victims as being wrong. It’s only weeks or months later after a more complete investigation we find out the police were wrong and they knew it from the beginning.

People are stupid for demanding that someone be fired over this. Any reasonable place would have people verifying stuff like this so there's no ""one"" person responsible. So if you fire an intern or offshore worker while leaving the policy of not having another person double-checking things, you create the same environment that caused the mistake (and ironically get rid of the one person that knows how to avoid the mistake)."

I respected the hell of the program as a whole. As I began to learn of the truth of the program, I felt and still feel torn and disillusioned. I know an old scout leader of mine now lives in Mexico after being on the run due to peeping Tom laws and was really heavily implied to have assaulted some boys.

It’s surprising to realize that the founder, Robert Baden-Powell, was also [a complete creep and a bastard who preyed on children](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/part-one-robert-baden-powell-founder-of-the-boy-scouts/id1373812661?i=1000540492836).

The victims rightfully get any and all compensation.  It breaks my heart the lifelong scars they now must carry,  and instead of a great experience with life skills, it's now a dark mark.

When abuse started coming to light, BSA instituted many safety protocols, adult training, and reporting methods to ensure Scout safety.  But the system was only as good as the adults not/enforcing them,  and too many Scouts suffered for too long.

He was a shaggy-haired electrician from california living in the flatlands of the suburban south, would drive us to campouts in his awesome ancient beat-to-hell crown victoria station wagon, and regale us with crazy stories about his surfing days back home. Saw his kid through to Eagle Scout, but loved the program and stayed on a few years thereafter.

In a program that was filled with lame dads who tried to live vicariously through their kids, my scoutmaster just wanted the kids to have fun, to stay safe, and to have opportunities to experience the outdoors. He was always the black sheep at the big summer camps and stuff, not at all an intellectual or rule-follower, but he was an incredibly sweet, gentle, and big-hearted dude. Never big on racking up merit badges and ranks and dumb shit like that, for him it was all about having positive and occasionally challenging outdoor experiences for the scouts.

I have no doubt there are/were plenty of bad actors in the Scouts (just like the church), so maybe I just lucked out. I was a kinda fat nerdy kid most of my time as a scout and he treated every scout equally.

Anyway, shout out to Mr. Ted."

Article Summary in 200ish Words:

Said bin Brahim bin Umran Bakush, a suspected African terrorist in U.S. custody at Guantanamo Bay, has been released and sent back to his home country of Algeria after over 20 years. Bakush was captured in Pakistan in 2001 and brought to Guantanamo in 2002 due to alleged ties to al-Qaida members. He was never charged, as investigators could not produce substantial evidence of his involvement in terrorism.

The Periodic Review Board decided last year that his continued detention was no longer necessary for U.S. national security. With Bakush's release, 30 inmates remain at Guantanamo prison, 16 of whom are eligible for transfer. President Joe Biden aims to shut down the controversial detention center before leaving office."

But we still need to Repeal the Faircloth Amendment.

Back in 1999, Clinton signed a bill that included the Faircloth Amendment, which forbid the federal government from building any new public housing that isn't replacing old public housing.

Different states have tried to get around it in various ways, but at the end of the day, HUD cannot help build new public housing without funding from the private sector.

And as we've all seen the rise in homelessness as well as rents, the private sector is not in the business of helping poor people actually afford a roof over their heads."

3342,Disney announces groundbreaking for affordable housing in Florida,11315,news,12slvt3,https://www.reuters.com/world/us/disney-announces-groundbreaking-affordable-housing-florida-2023-04-20/,938,"So as an Orlando area resident I think this needs some context for those who are saying it's ""dystopian"" that Disney is building affordable housing for their employees.

**One of the major issues right now in Orlando is a lack of affordable housing, and a severe lack of affordable housing near the parks.**

Basically if Disney doesn't build the housing themselves, nobody will as the land near the parks is much more valuable to developers as single family million dollar homes they can sell, or expensive apartments.

You can see this in two master planned communities near the parks that were ""supposed"" to have affordable options. One historic old, one brand new.

Celebration is the old community. It was actually built by Disney themselves as a homage to walts EPCOT plan, but is its own entity that has no connection to the company anymore. Celebration is within 5 minutes of park property and pretty much every single peice of rentable housing has be re-zoned into condos that now sell for upwards of $650K+. The houses there are even more insane generally starting in the upper $800Ks.

A new community would be Championsgate. Again another master planned community about a 5-10 minute drive from the parks. Most of the houses here were supposed to be sold at market value (so around 400K-500K for a 3-4 bedroom). Most of the houses in Championsgate are being sold to rich retirees, or landlords who Airbnb the houses out for insane amounts of money. And even if you could snatch one as a young family with a parent who works at Disney, the monthly $600 HOA fee will probably drive you away.

You could argue the state needs to build it. But do you really want desantis and his cronies running state affiliated affordable housing near WDW?

So that leaves the only option as Disney doing it themselves."

Love and Thunder and Quantumania did have some funny moments, but also had some stinker jokes. It’s also like they didn’t know how to combine a humorous and a serious tone at the same time. D&D balanced serious and humorous tones *gloriously* and had amazing humor all throughout."
3364,"Hopefully 2023's Dungeons & Dragons movie results in more ""just pure fun"" movies in the future",2440,movies,12vmygz,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/12vmygz/hopefully_2023s_dungeons_dragons_movie_results_in/,328," 
The humor works because, unlike a lot of recent big-budget action movies—and appropriately for a D&D movie—it comes from the characters. The jokes aren’t generic meta/ironic wisecracks about silly genre conventions, but result naturally from their various flaws. The barbarism is blunt, the druid is cynical, the paladin is humorless, the sorcerer is nervous, the bard is charismatic to a fault (part of his arc involves being *too* encouraging).

The story works not because of the literal series of events, but because it’s built around a solid theme. The protagonist has an external quest to complete, but more importantly, he faces an inner challenge, that can’t be overcome by might or magic, and requires leveling up as a person, not a class. The screenplay isn’t a collection of fourth wall-breaking commentary, but an earnest exploration of a group of people learning and growing together. The humor works because the story has heart, and is built around relationships, rather than the now-repetitive format of a single person embracing their destiny—like most recent Disney franchises.

It may not be the best movie I’ve ever seen, but I’m hard-pressed to figure out how we could have gotten a better D&D movie than we got. It’s not LOTR but in terms of making me smile, it’s the best fantasy film since Willow."

I loved how committed all the actors seemed to every silly thing and line they had to do, just as committed as they were to the more serious scenes. It definitely has a lot of heart and I actually feel like the characters like each other and have well defined personalities. The band of heroes themselves is just really likeable, it's great seeing them triumph and work towards becoming better versions of themselves. 

I think one of my favorite jokes has to be the paladin's comment about how he ""finds irony to be a blade that cuts those who wield it etc"" only for Chris pine to reply, ""really? do you find that?"" It was such a good delivery. 😂 There's another one when the paladin leaves, something like, ""there he goes. Just walking in a straight line.""

And the animatronics! I was not expecting animatronics or puppetry at all! The heist with the mirror and the wild shape scenes are both such good action beats, and both villains are great...dang I really hope they make a sequel. I'll watch all the silly fantasy adventures hollywood wants to make."

Back in the early 2000s Dame Edna performed in my town. If you are unfamiliar with Dame Edna it was a man who dressed in drag as an aristocratic English woman or Australian woman…. He performed in front of royalty and was on many TV shows back in the day….

My mother was under hospice care and was in an electric wheelchair. We attended and had one of the best nights of my life.

If you never had the pleasure of attending a Dame Edna show he often picked on people in the audience and that night he chose to pick on me. 

As Dame Edna he asked me questions about my home decorations to which my answer was often the color beige. What color was my carpet? Beige. What color were my blinds? Beige.  He had the audience in stitches and commented that I look like a very beige person to her.

My mother was laughing harder than I think I've ever seen her laugh…

At one point in the show he called up various audience members to dress in costumes and he dressed me as the fat Fergie.  Fergie being the Duchess of York, wife of Prince Andrew.

It was hilarious and at the end he gave me a big hug and my very expensive eyeglasses caught with her very expensive eyeglasses and we were tied together literally.  The audience was screaming with laughter as we tried to untangle ourselves.

Honestly one of the funniest and happiest nights of my life because my mother was so very happy which made me very happy, too.

I always meant to write a letter to Dame Edna to let him know what that night meant to both of us but I think he might have known.  After all out of that audience he picked a woman sitting next to the elderly woman in the electric wheelchair….

He was amazingly funny, but I think he also had a heart of gold….  May his soul be blessed with eternal life and perhaps my mother will meet him in heaven."

Even the opening scene is incredible. Suzy walking through the airport, sees the automatic doors in front of her, and every time they open the Goblin score comes in...only to become silent when they close again. The look on her face suggests that she notices it too.

It gives the impression that she's leaving the real world and entering a nightmarish fairy tale. It's fantastic.

As a result, a ton of the scenes have clear audio sync issues, but it’s super subtle, just barely off here or there (except when it’s *absolutely not*, lol), which really helps contribute to the weird, dream-like feel of the movie. 

And the violence is truly nightmarish - not “oh it’s so scary!”, but it feels almost…imaginary? That opening scene?!?

It’s absolutely a brain melter, it’s bonkers. 

It feels pretentious to say it’s a pretty good horror movie but an absolutely stunning piece of art, but that’s really what it feels like, it’s just so visually *interesting*, and that Goblin soundtrack is *WILD*. It’s one to my favorites, it’s so good!!"

Whoa. Okay, that's a fairly major new bit of information.

Edit for replies -

1) I never suggested this clears the armorer, because it absolutely doesn't. The main issue here was always the bullet getting into the gun. I hope she is prosecuted to the full extent the law provides for. 

2) However, while I didn't think Baldwin was lying, frankly I also didn't believe him. The new information here is that the Prosecutor accepts his account is possible. This changes my understanding of the sequence of events.

3) Stop suggesting he should have cleared the gun himself. That would be an absolutely terrible and unworkable rule on a movie set and there's a reason it's not done like that there.

4) Actors are required to point guns at people all the time, don't get silly by pretending you don’t know that. Clint Eastwood's career is defined by images of him aiming at people."

Crash : carwash scene torn between sexual fantasy and actual rape

Birth : theatre shot when we can see Kidman’s face going through various anxious emotions

Autumn Sonata : suffering sister close-up shots in the bedroom

The Sacrifice : introduction dialogue on the field

Kaïro : shadows appearances on the wall

The Face of Another : crowd scene at the end

Ring : THE TAPES (even the surrealist take from the US version)

Neon Demon : Shooting naked, gold paint scene

Dressed to Kill : metro pursuit

But the choice to make it a 3 hour “epic” shines a bright light on all its flaws. The movie can’t settle on a protagonist. The camera never stops moving. The performances are all too showy in a “nominate me for an Oscar” kind of way. The movie keeps biting off more than it can chew thematically, and introducing subplots that don’t really go anywhere. There’s too much gross-out stuff and it feels pointless.

So when I sat through three hours of that stuff, and then the grand payoff was a condescending circle jerk about the magic of cinema, I felt personally affronted. It’s one thing to waste my time, but quite another to waste that much of my time and then insult me at the end."

3499,Official Discussion - Ghosted [SPOILERS],83,movies,12ve48b,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/12ve48b/official_discussion_ghosted_spoilers/,191,"Oh boy alright this was something else - objectively, Chris Evans character is definitely a creeper and it feels like he only gets away with his unruly pursuit of Ana de Armas because he's handsome and eventually helps take down this overly complicated criminal scheme. Chris Evans texting de Armas a dozen times and flying to London for this girl is painted as just him being too clingy, but I think it truly goes a step further than clingy. Also taking a picture of the girl you just slept with while she's asleep naked is weird and definitely goes beyond clingy as well.

Ana de Armas, on the other hand, is also odd in this movie - it seems to imply she is cold-blooded killer and has no emotions, but it doesn't really go anywhere with that.

The first part of this film that took place in DC was hilarious too, because it felt like every other shot would have the two mains walking and then the shot would just pause on a monument to really let you know this was filmed in DC (which it was a big deal around here when they were spotted filming - and when someone told me the title of the film was Ghosted, I was really hoping it was a Ghost-like premise and not, well, this shit).

The only real worthwhile part is the scene where every bounty hunter, in a plethora of cameos, just inexplicably kills one another one after the other. But even then, there's a sort of comedic tone to that scene that is just not present anywhere else in the film so it feels jarring put against everything else. I also do love the randomness of John Cho - not sure if him and Evans have any kind of connection, since Evans has a clear connection to the other two assassins. Also Ryan Reynolds cameo in Bullet Train last year was great - his cameo in Ghosted this year was not so great."

Did anyone watch this movie, and for even a moment, feel like they were watching real people and their real problems?  

Did any of the characters come off like someone you know or could sympathize with? 

To me, they always came off as actors playing a movie role. All of them. 

Did anyone watch it and feel like they were being transported back in time, to when these events occurred? 

Too many celebrity actors, dressed too well, reading lines that were too good, in a movie that was too fancy, and not gritty and real in any way, shape or form. 

That’s why I can’t get into the movie.

I’m glad you liked it. I’m just explaining why I didn’t, because you indicated you’re surprised people don’t."

That and Babylon were two of my favorite movies of the year and neither gathered much attention. 

I saw both in the theaters twice, as well.

I thought Amsterdam had a lot of heart in it, it had a good story with some humor and a nice message and of course Christian Bale, but the rest of the cast was excellent too. 

It felt like it went beyond the normal expectation of the plot they set forth in the beginning in order to tie into the real issue that it wanted to cover, but I like when a movie goes off the formula a touch. I especially liked the dodo subplot.

I heart huckabees is my favorite existential detective movie, and I watched the DVD so much at night that when I hear the theme music I have flashbacks to waking up to the Dvd menu screen on loop."

Orson Welles turned in a 2 hour and 10 minute epic about the rise and fall of a rich family in pre and post-invention of the automobile Indianapolis, starting off with an idealic shot of a fancy house and (originally) ending with a shot of a car driving away under an overhead bridge with smoke rising from every direction.

While Welles was in Brazil to shoot a documentary for the US war effort, the studio screened this 130 minute depressing film in front of an audience before their 90 minute comedy. The audience DESPISED it and the studio panicked and while Welles was gone, removed 50 minutes of footage, and filmed a new, happy ending without him.

The final film is still one of my favorite movies, but the best version of the film is forever out of reach. In a way, it's very fitting for a film about a lost golden age that we can never experience again."

**\*\*HEAD'S UP - Due to the Rotational Nature of TUBI's Lineup, some movies may no longer be available at the time of this post. But if it's on the list, TUBI will bring it back eventually\*\***

&#x200B;

**Why did you do this?**

Two Halloweens ago I did 2 horror movies a night leading up to the 31st. It actually started becoming a daily thing. Several months ago, I started focusing entirely on Tubi and decided to make a list of all the movies I watched. I figured others may enjoy some of the gems I discovered so I wanted to share the list with people.

I've been getting a lot of positive feedback for this list since we first shared it, so I've been updating it every 50 movies to share with the community.

&#x200B;

**What rules did you set?**

If I made it 20 minutes into a movie, I had to finish it no matter what the quality. This led me to agonize through several rough movies like Vamp-Father and BloodRayne; but it also helped me see a few other films I'd never complete such as Portrait of Dorian Grey or Curse of Sleeping Beauty.

&#x200B;

**Find any new great movies this during this update?**

Yes! Off the top of my head I would have to include:

* Monkey Shines
* Puppet Master 3rd Reich
* Death Becomes Her
* In the Mouth of Madness

**Find any new Terrible movies during this update?**

God yes...

* Blood Rayne
* Hellraiser Revelations
* Vamp Father
* The Bye Bye Man

I did see The Conjuring opening weekend, and that was one of the funnest experiences with a crowd I've ever had. Not only was it actually a scary movie, but the tension and scenes were outrageous. My brother at the time was a 300lb competitive powerlifter. We saw it in theaters and he almost walked out. I'd leave the house when I knew he was coming home from work in 30 minutes. I'd play the conjuring blu-ray and time it around the scenes where she walks around the house playing hide and seek.  
  
I think Conjuring (2012) and Black Panther (2018) opening weekend (with a theater that was 95% African-Americans) are the two best movie going experiences I've had. After that, Dark Knight 2008 when midnight releases were still a thing and the line around the the theater stretched around the block for a midnight release. Transformers 2007 was same way. Avengers End Game was also major hype in a full theater.  
  
Not to get too off topic, but Thursday evening releases are so convenient, that I miss the hype of midnight Friday releases. If you worked restaurant industry everyone cleaning up the restaurant as soon as possible to close, to get tickets (this was way before online ticketing was so easy and fandango). Everyone just being a geek and fan at midnight with the lines super long. And everyone getting out of the theater and parking lots scrambling at 2-3am to get home and sleep hahaha."

I watched it at night after a busy day. Thanks to my physical fatigue at that time I thought it was the most boring movie I had ever seen in my life. I managed to complete it but sitting through was an unforgettably arduous experience.

Some months later I decided to give the film a rewatch after getting free from my works. And ngl I loved every minute of the film in second viewing. It was a beautiful, somber and occasionally thrilling and ominous experience. I was surprised by how powerful the whole film was. It's final scene where Deckard get to reunite with his daughter meanwhile K succumbs to his injuries with snow-falling all over him replete with that tears-in-rain music is one of the most emotional scenes I have ever seen in movies. 

*Blade Runner 2049* is now the most humane cyberpunk film in my book."

I think?. I touched the Triceratops! I stood face to face with a raptor!  They brought in a T-rex skeleton for size comparison as the actual props used were multiple. 

Anyway. I also love the Jurassic World movies. The most recent is a fitting end and part of me hopes they don't make any more. Dominion completes it. 

Fallen Kingdom. Ok. Wow. Didn't know about the detail you just described. I had never heard of the deleted scenes. What?!?!  These would have helped so much. The context provided would have brought answers to so many questions. One of my burning questions was ""where the hell is the nanny?” no way in hell would she just accept being fired and simply walk away. British, stoic yes. Abandon a child? Nope not on your life. I knew something had to be missing but hadn't realised such had been left out. 

Thanks for this. I usually go to the books to flesh out the missing parts so when I re-watch later, those parts are imbedded in my head almost to the point I can see them. I re-watched and re-read the Harry Potter series in this way too. 

I now need to marathon the franchise again. 

Happy days."

You have to be in the WGA in order to be credited for writing.

I guarantee you that most rewrites are not an actor sitting in their trailer rewriting the script. Sometimes that lines are changed on the fly. It doesn’t mean an actor deserves a writing credit. Movies are collaborative that way.

Also, it’s kind of a shit move for an actor.  Imagine the actor bringing in some of their own wardrobe from home and requesting a costume designer credit, or making suggestions about the directing, and wanting a co-Director credit, or suggesting a camera move or frame, and requiring a Director of photography credit. 

Movies are collaborative. Plenty of people have been put in lots of ways, but they don’t demand screen credit unless they’ve hired to do that job."

Arnie made genuinely good and interesting movies in those 10 years after Terminator. Even Conan The Barbarian actually spends time layering in themes based on Conan's experiences about the nature of true strength (his father says it's the weapon, but immediately dies. Thulsa Doom tells him it's his body that makes him strong, but Conan was captured and beaten at this time, so that's not right either. After this, Conan starts being sneakier, setting traps and using makeup to engage in psychological warfare... A strong mind makes him far more effective, but he still struggles to overcome Thulsa's hyonotic trance. In the end, it is the will to succeed that allows Conan to win, and that is the true nature of strength).

This is why I never really got into Commando. Short of a couple classic one liners (""I lied!""), the actual story and action are so generic compared to the rest of what he was producing at the time. Arnold was working with some of the most influential directors of the decade, and it shows in the output. He was starring in several genre-defining classics."

3777,EILI5: What does it mean when one of the starring actors is also an 'executive producer' on a movie/tv show,5,movies,12v8o9e,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/12v8o9e/eili5_what_does_it_mean_when_one_of_the_starring/,23,"

When a starring actor is also listed as an ""executive producer"" on a movie or TV show, it means that they not only have a leading role in the project but also have a significant amount of creative and financial control over the production. 

As an executive producer, the actor may have contributed to the development of the project, from the initial pitch to the final script, and may have had a hand in casting decisions, hiring key crew members, and overseeing the overall production process. They may also have contributed financially to the project or secured funding for it.

Having an actor as an executive producer can also mean that they have a greater say in the final cut of the project, including editing decisions, and may have the ability to veto certain creative choices. It can also give them a share of the profits, both from the production and any subsequent sales or syndication.

Overall, being an executive producer on a movie or TV show gives the actor a greater degree of creative and financial control over the project, beyond just their performance on screen."

Some actors might be EPs to help get the project made.

Some might get way into the nitty gritty.

It depends on the project.


>Do they co-finance the project? 

The rule is you don't make movies with your own money but it happens.

Bill Murray wrote a check to Wes Anderson to cover the cost of a helicopter shot in Rushmore when the studio wouldn't.  

Tommy Wiseau paid for the Room.

George Clooney mortgaged his house to make Leatherheads.

Mel Gibson paid for Apocalypto and Passion of the Christ.

Shane Carruth self-funded both of his films.

Drew Barrymore paid for part of Donnie Darko.

Actor/producers signing on to a project are a lure for money people, though.

>Do they co-write

Sometimes.

George Clooney wrote, directed, and produced The Ides of March, The Monuments Men, and Suburbicon.

David Michod wrote, directed, and produced the King.

Matt Reeves wrote, directed, and produced the Batman.

It happens.

>or split in the profits? 

Sometimes.

Tom Cruise made Top gun 2 with Paramount Pictures, Skydance, TC Productions, New Republic Pictures, and Don Simpson/Jerry Bruckheimer Films. He stands to earn $200 million from the deal:

https://www.ibtimes.com/tom-cruise-top-gun-maverick-salary-actor-could-earn-200-million-3526348

>It can't be just a vanity title or something right. Hope someone can enligten me.

It depends on the actor's relationship with the studio that produces the project. 

Take Beef:

Lee Sung Jin had an idea for a tv show.

Jin is friends with Steven Yeun, who leveraged his celebrity and relationship with A24 to start a bidding war:

Take Hunters:

David Weil created the show.

Weil knew Jordan Peele and brought his ideas to him. Peele used his clout to get the show to executives at Amazon - who bought it:

Some people point out creative control  and money but if the actor or actress made a phone call that made a differance, 'executive producer' credit is due.

It is a catch all title to credit people that made the movie happen.  

It falls under creative control.  Some productions will credit anyone for anything, others get nobody but The Man.  You see nobody but the lead Actor as executive producer it means they had that written into their contract, so you know who The Man was."

I don't think films like that were widely shown on TV back then. There was no Cable, and no home-media like VHS. 

Kids in later decades could easily catch a film that's not age-appropriate on Cable, or because their parents/siblings left a VHS lying around. For 1950s' kids, these experiences would be limited to films that their parents would take them to at the cinema, which they would mostly not do with horror films, etc.  
So ""traumatic"" experiences were limited to films that *were* age-appropriate and had child audiences but that contained one or two disturbing scenes nonetheless (like the ones mentioned in the thread: *Wizard of Oz* and *Bambi*)."

My GF and I are also post-grads/mid-40s/introverts.. and Star Trek has been the biggest instigator of deeper conversations. A lot of it is _very_ well written indeed (some episodes are not, of course 😄). My particular preferences are The Next Generation, Voyager and Strange New Worlds. — and my interests lean towards anything that questions what it means to be human, eg: A lot of android/robot related stuff.

Industry trade publications report all the movie/TV news: who got cast in what, what shows are succeeding/cancelled, what stars are doing what, etc. This is the reading material on the lobby coffee table at every production company and studio.

Each article also usually helpfully provides a summary of whatever show/movie they're talking about, or at least a succinct description. 

It's a little overwhelming and there's a learning curve until you get a sense of the names and titles, but it'd definitely keep you up to speed.

In addition, when you watch something and maybe you're unsure of it's praise or cinematic techniques used I would research the movie online (here on Reddit, YouTube, film critics, etc.). There are tons of great resources out there that can guide to understanding movies and media better. Hope this was helpful!

Trucking is one of the most drug-free and law abiding professions I know of nowadays due to the fact that it is VERY tightly regulated by both the feds and state governments. Drug testing is commonplace and extremely strict, with nearly career-ending penalties for a first time failure.

The story is entirely forgettable. In fact, I honestly forget most the plot in all of them except >!his dog being murdered to kick the whole series off!<.  The action truly is great, but it's not quite enough to stave off my boredom of being mostly indifferent to everything else. 

They're okay.  Worth watching. 

I do love Keanu, though. And I love the fact that he literally went from the guy we all made fun of from the 90s to like 2009 to the guy the entire web loves unconditionally without a shadow of doubt because he's just a kind and decent man.

The expanded universe is kind of ridiculous. I mean, John Wick kills SOOOO many professional assassins in 2 and 3. I mean, if there are really that many professionals just in NYC alone, who can find him by the dozens within minutes of getting flagged as a target... I mean WTF, how is there even that much assassin work, and some kind of massive network like that would end up exposed in some way because there is way too many points of exposure.

But, at the same time, it's kind of a fun universe, and the action is great, so you give those kind of flaws a pass.

I personally didn't like the way they turned the Continental and so on into such a political organization. I wish they had done something a bit more interesting than to have it just being political feuding over power.

But again, are the movies awesome just for the action? Absolutely.

It's like John Wick 4. The most deadly assassin of them all is a blind guy? That's just pure Japanese anime nonsense and completely unrealistic and just stupid, if you take a step back and think about it. But, if you let go and just have fun and don't think about it too hard, it's freakin awesome to watch with 10/10 entertainment value, regardless of how illogical it is, and it's kind of fun that they did that whole old-school blind master trope from the Japanese fighter genre and put it into John Wick.

So, is it overrated? Maybe a little. The great thing about the series though is it is one of those movies where if it is already playing, you are more than happy to sit down and start watching it just because so many of the scenes, from literally every movie are great."

There's a whole doc about the disastrous production of this film called ""Island of Lost Souls"" that's way more entertaining than the actual finished film.

The gist being that weirdo eccentric autuer Richard Stanely (""Hardware"", ""Dust Devil"" & ""The Color out of Space"") managed to stumble his way into a major budget adaptation of Moroue that goes to absolute shit basically immediately thanks to: 

Absurd/devastating tropical rainfall, the cast full of big ego primadonas like Marlon Brando/Val Kilmer being completely insufferable and tons of bizarre horrid luck like the directors assistant being bitten by a highly venomous spider in her hotel. Although the real core problem is that Stanley is such a fucking weird, anxious and frankly up his own ass guy that he has a breakdown the second the project starts ramping up. Like seriously I know that the entertainment industry will deal with a lot but the guy just could not handle basic communication and was replaced after a few days by Frankenheimer.

Also it turned out that Stanley is seemingly an abuser of women, so now the doc doesn't even suffer from the ""tragedy"" of this budding auteurs career dying because fuck that guy."

Wesley Snipes  and the director (forgot his name) did not get along at all. There came a time when they wouldn't even talk to one another and go-betweens were communicating for them. Wesley would outright refuse to follow the director's instructions and there is a scene where he is lying on a table and his eyes are supposed to be open, but he deliberately kept them closed. They had CGI his eyes in that scene.

Wesley would stay in character even off screen. There is a lot more that happened behind the scenes that I don't remember but the IMDb trivia should have it."

4117,Question regarding the ending of No Country For Old Men…,12,movies,12ukvx4,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/12ukvx4/question_regarding_the_ending_of_no_country_for/,26,"The point of the scene isn’t his invincibility. It has to do with the overall theme. This story is told in a world where people’s ethics go only as far as their personal interest. In this world Anton, reigns supreme not in his killing ability, but in his commitment to what he does. He alone keeps his word with integrity. When he does have his own doubts, he leaves it to a coin toss. 

So in this final scene, Anton gets caught by sheer chance, or maybe some cosmic karma. But he gets away by buying off a greedy teen. Again, he relies on the limited ethics of all around him. It is this flipping of principled individual that gives us this very intriguing tale and Anton his power. 

In this McCarthy delivers a story with a social warning. The Cohen’s modify it to keep with their commitment that stories aren’t morality and that storytellers are here for the storytelling and nothing else. In both cases, the bad guy gets away because he’s more committed to being a bad guy than his opponents are at being the god guys."
4118,Question regarding the ending of No Country For Old Men…,12,movies,12ukvx4,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/12ukvx4/question_regarding_the_ending_of_no_country_for/,26,The question I always had is what was the ending supposed to be symbolic of… like it was good acting from Tommy Lee Jones but all these years later I just remember him giving a short monologue and the movie ending. Felt like a weird way to end it.

Is Anton symbolic of a random world that kills when it wants, Indifferent to people, incomprehensible in nature. Or is he an enforcer of the fate and predetermined outcome the characters had been “putting up” their whole lives."

In other words, Anton is now in the same position, totally a victim of fate.

Also he’s not just injured but seriously fucked - his arm bone is hanging out! He will be lucky not to die of shock in the next few hours. No more badass hitman days for him."

Harry Potter is a franchise with a built in fan base and markets itself. They probably had other (smaller) movies at the time that they campaigned to be nominated so they could bring more publicity to them.

WB was the distributor for Million Dollar Baby which won a ton of Oscars in the award season that Prisoner of Azkaban would have been eligible for so they probably focused most of their attention on campaigns for that movie."

The ruling People’s Action Party (PAP) and the opposition Workers’ Party (WP) have both reported greater numbers of young volunteers in recent years, with the Progress Singapore Party (PSP) reporting that 15% of its members are younger than 35. While exact figures have not been disclosed, volunteers have reported seeing more young people on the ground.  
  
The article also notes that the trend towards youth involvement in politics runs counter to studies which suggest that Singaporeans are generally politically uninterested, with almost two-thirds expressing disinterest in politics. However, some young people are joining political parties as a way to engage with issues they care about.  
  
The article quotes several young volunteers who explain their reasons for getting involved in party activities. A PAP youth activist, Jakelyn Yong, cites issues such as women’s development and the needs of the ageing population as being close to her heart. Similarly, a WP volunteer, Claudia Selvakumar, says that the party’s stances on many issues resonate with her.  
  
The article also includes comments from a regional chair of a PAP branch, who suggests that young people are becoming more politically engaged due to a sense of agency in an era of increased political contestation. However, the chair also expresses concern about the high turnover rate of young volunteers.  
  
The article notes that the emergence of opposition parties with more credible candidates and greater electability has also served to meet the demand for political participation, as has the ruling party's large-scale national conversations and new initiatives like youth panels.

COEs are auctioned off in a bidding process, and the price of each COE is determined by the demand for it. The author notes that COE prices have been rising rapidly, with the premium for bigger and more powerful cars hitting a new record of $120,889 at the latest tender on April 19.

The article explains that there are several factors driving the increase in COE prices. First, there is replacement demand, as many people buy new cars every three to five years. Second, there has been an influx of foreigners since the Covid-19 pandemic began, many of whom are seeking to buy cars. Third, car sellers are promoting their vehicles and telling consumers they should buy soon because COE prices will go higher. Fourth, speculation may be driving prices up again, just as it did in the past.

The article points out that there are similarities between private-hire firms and the speculators who drove COE prices to six-digit levels three decades ago. Private-hire firms are able to pass higher costs to vehicle hirers, dispose of unhired cars by converting them into normal cars and selling them as used vehicles, and reduce supply for individual consumers, which drives up demand for rental cars.

The author notes that private-hire firms may be bidding aggressively to keep COE premiums high for as long as possible. However, when COE prices start to slide, these firms will be stuck with an expensive fleet of cars that they cannot rent out or resell.

The article concludes by noting that the government has been trying to cool the COE market by introducing far more punitive taxes for costlier cars. However, this has had limited success, and the author suggests that more measures may be needed to address the issue."

Now the whole system is skewed by (1) private hire,  and (2) (possibly) luxury cars. It seems like the system is due for an overhaul.

There's broadly two types of 99-1.

There's this method below mentioned in the article when you buy from the seller in a 99-1 split in a single transaction. These aren't the ones potentially in trouble with IRAS as there is no ABSD due that is avoided - ABSD is due on the full price or market value of the property based on the highest rate applicable to all purchasers.

> When they buy their first property, they make it such that one of them gets a 99 per cent share of the property, while the other receives a mere one per cent share. They're still buying the property as a couple, so they have the advantage of two incomes when applying for a home loan.

> When they find a second investment property they want to buy, the person with the one per cent transfers their share to the one with 99 per cent.

The ones IRAS is looking into are those where a buyer not subject to ABSD (or a lower rate of ABSD) buys a unit from the seller and pays no (or the lower rate of ABSD). This buyer then shortly after sells 1% to a second buyer who is subject to a higher rate of ABSD (e.g. he owns another property). This avoids the higher rate of ABSD being paid on 99% of the property. If done for tax purposes, the legislation allows IRAS to take action to claim back the tax avoided, i.e ABSD on 99% of the property, and more. It may require some background to understand,  I [wrote](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/12dn3uq/99to1_property_scheme_iras_conducting_regular/jf7bg6v/) on this a while back."

One can guess it's just parenting of that era.

Where a person lacks self-identity, they will seek it in all sorts of places. Most often the easiest to align with.

But I have my hypothesis on why specifically that vintage of people are more prone to falling for it.

They are swept up in a rapidly changing world and most people find change uncomfortable. They find themselves fast becoming irrelevant and alienated as time goes on. 

This isn't the twelfth century where they can give farming advice that was true for the previous hundred years and will remain true for the next hundred.

This feeling of displacement drives them towards seeking something that gives them some form of relevance and validation. 

But why Chinese propaganda? Because that's literally the one thing that won't change, their birth. It is therefore the least effort required to pick what they think will be the winning side. 

It is a very strange version of ""I told you so!'

But this isn't limited only to your father, American conservatives who feel increasingly alienated will align with increasingly extreme beliefs that validate their person. 

Back in the 90s when China was poor and the US was peaking, I'm pretty sure your dad held a rosy &  positive view of the Americans. 

It's all about picking the winning side.

But how do you pull him away from that bad influence? You have to give him the validation he never got from his parents.

That's a whole path of healing and healing others. It's gonna be difficult work and not required of you. But it's always a choice."

4262,Go West: More Singapore firms setting up shop in the US,23,singapore,12vqevi,https://www.straitstimes.com/world/united-states/go-west-more-singapore-firms-setting-up-shop-in-the-us,17,"I think one of the biggest challenge to expanding overseas is how different the business environment is out there.

Singapore has low corporate taxes, huge amount of grant and subsidies gravy for businesses, low (depressed) labour costs, weak labour protection, low corruption, etc. This has created an “easy profit” environment and a “lazy” mindset. For example, the government needs to “bribe” SMEs with grants and subsidies to enhance their own productivity (and thus profits).

Many of these benefits will not be available overseas. For example, in Europe, the corporate taxes are high and labour protection laws are very strong. In Asian countries, there’s under-the-table corruption and entrenched cronyism. Etc.

Essentially, for Singaporean businesses to expand overseas, they need to realise just how pro-business SG is and they need to adapt to much less business friendly (or even “hostile”) environments. That is in addition to targeting the right customer base overseas for their products and services.

That, I think, is why only very few Singaporean businesses can successfully venture overseas. The bulk of our lazy, inefficient, uncompetitive SMEs cannot even compete in SG if the environment was less pro-business, let alone *overseas*.

You see how much some of those SMEs complain at every mention of any (slightly) less pro-business policy in SG, do you think they stand a chance overseas?

Pro-business policies are not entirely negative, they can have good intentions. But the intention and reality has become mismatched. You think SG is encouraging good businesses, but in reality, we bred the “lazy fat asses”.

Those “lazy fat asses” cannot expand overseas. They are not going to bring wealth from elsewhere, and they probably are a parasite to Singapore’s prosperity and economic growth. The huge amount of resources we gave them are resources we cannot give to enable other more productive and competitive firms.

That’s why Singapore need to be less pro-business a bit. Singapore is a small market, businesses must constantly think of tapping onto the wider world. We need competitive businesses to tap onto opportunities elsewhere, not lazy uncompetitive businesses leeching off taxpayers and dependent on lax regulations like some sort of clutches.

Being a little bit less pro-business does not destroy the economy and halt private enterprises. Nokia, the former Finnish tech giant, was based in the Nordic countries known for high taxes and strong labour regulations. Same for Ericsson, an internationally well known telecommunications company from Sweden. Businesses adapt and thrive in Europe, even in notoriously pro-labour countries like France (where people go on strike for any reason).

SG needs to be strategic on the business gravy we are handling out. It needs to make SMEs more competitive, not less. We need to encourage them to be better, and not just to become nepotic parasites on the economy."

Bikes are essentially weightless when they are upright on their two wheels. Like there's no difference between a Honda msx or a BMW GSA. You can look up YouTube on how people can literally balance the bike with only one finger. My point being that technique is more important. 

There is a technique where you shift your ass to the left side of the seat so you can better touch the ground when you come to a stop. It's better to learn on a school bike and drop it on its side a hundred times, rather than pass and drop your own bike once."

If not, good luck in finding.

If ICA sent undercover officers during the PCR requirement period to work in travel swab agents, they would realise that there are many Singaporeans with foreign passports. It is a ""crime"" to have dual citizenships but its a common practice for Singaporeans living overseas.

I had done official translation services for foreigners who commited petty crimes in Singapore. Most had their passports seized during investigations. When desperate, many found ways to obtain new passports through embassies, dark web or 3rd party services. They left Singapore without even being red flagged.

So maybe its time ICA loosen up some rules."

There is also no such thing as fake or forged. Indonesian, Thai or Philippine passport. They are actual real passport obtained thru corrupt immigration officials.

4418,Releasing confidential data could harm Singapore's social compact: Tan See Leng,24,singapore,12uweuw,https://youtu.be/A0UMs_rS4ME,76,"Even Ong Teng Cheong the President struggled to get data from the government when it is vital for his role.

>It was this issue that caused the dispute between you and the government?

""Yes. But I don't want to go into details and upset everybody. The thing is that the elected president is supposed to protect the reserves, but he was not told what these are until five years later. From the day the Constitution was amended in 1991 to provide for an elected president, he was supposed to fulfil that role. My predecessor, Wee Kim Wee, although he was not elected, was supposed to play that role during the last two years of his term. But he did not actively check. So, when I came in in 1993, I asked for all this information about the reserves. It took them three years to give it to me.""

>The holdup was for administrative reasons?

""Either that or they did not think there was any urgency. You see, if you ask me to protect the reserves, then you've got to tell me what I'm supposed to protect. So I had to ask.""

>Why did they not want to tell you?

""I do not know. Don't ask me, because I don't have the answer. I've been asking them. In fact, in 1996, exactly halfway through my term, I wrote prime minister Goh a letter. At that time, everybody was expecting a general election in December or January. After the election, a new government would be sworn in. When that happens, all the reserves, whether past or current, become past reserves and are locked up on the changeover date. As president, I have to safeguard them and they can only be drawn upon with my permission. So I said to Mr Goh: It's already halfway through my term, but until today I still don't know all these figures about the reserves.""

>So the government had been stonewalling you, the president, for three years?

""Yes. What happened actually was, as you know, in accounting, when you talk about reserves, it's either cash reserves or assets reserves. The cash side is straightforward: investment, how many million dollars here and there, how much comes from the investment boards and so on. That was straightforward -- but still we had to ask for it. For the assets, like properties and so on, normally you say it's worth $30 million or $100 million or whatever. But they said it would take 56-man years to produce a dollar-and-cents value of the immovable assets. So I discussed this with the accountant-general and the auditor-general and we came to a compromise. The government would not need to give me the dollar-and-cents value, just give me a listing of all the properties that the government owns.""

>They agreed?

""Well, yes, they agreed, but they said there's not the time for it. It took them a few months to produce the list. But even when they gave me the list, it was not complete.""

>It seems the Singapore government does not know its own assets?

""Yes. It's complicated. It's never been done before. And for the assets of land, I can understand why. Every piece of land, even a stretch of road, is probably subdivided into many lots. There are 50,000 to 60,000 lots and every one has a number. If you want to value them all, it would take a long time. In the past, they have just locked everything up and assumed it is all there. But if I am to protect it, at least I want to know the list.""

>When they eventually gave you the list -- the incomplete list, did you have enough staff to do the checking and other work?

""No, I did not. I only had one administrative staffer and two part-timers from the auditor-general's office. For things like approving the budget of statutory boards, the auditor-general's office would normally go through that for me. They are very good. They check on everything. And they query and ask for information.""

>For government financial policy matters that you had a veto over, did you get all the details?

""They finally came with an executive summary to say that they had checked through all this, and that this is what they have, this is how much they are going to spend, and that it won't need any draw from the reserves -- or that there's likely to be a draw. There never was a draw during my time, but there were instances where it was a bit dicey whether the budgets of one or two statutory boards would require a draw. But finally we resolved that.""

>Eventually then, with the list of properties and the executive summaries, you were kept informed?

""I wouldn't be able to say that. Even in my last year as president, I was still not being informed about some ministerial procedures. For example, in April last year, the government said it would allow the sale of the Post Office Savings Bank POSB to DBS Bank. In the past, when there was no elected president, they could just proceed with this kind of thing. But when there is an elected president you cannot, because the POSB is a statutory board whose reserves are to be protected by the president. You cannot just announce this without informing him. But I came to know of it from the newspaper. That is not quite right. Not only that, but they were even going to submit a bill to parliament for this sale and to dissolve the POSB without first informing me.""

>What did you do?

""My office went to tell them that this was the wrong procedure. You've got to do this first, do that first, before you can do this. It was question of principle and procedure. We had to bring all this to their attention. That they cannot forget us. It's not that we are busybodies, but under the Constitution we have a role to play and a responsibility. Sometimes in the newspaper I came to know of things that I am responsible for, but if it had not been reported in the newspaper I would not know about it.""

>You must have been pretty angry that this was still happening in your last year as president? 

""Yes, I was a bit grumpy. And maybe not to the liking of the civil service. They did not like what I said. But I have to be a watchdog all the time, you see. So this is where they are supposed to help me to protect the reserves. And not for me to go and watch out when they do right or wrong.""

>Under the Constitution, you have the right to all the information available to the cabinet.

""Yes. That's right. And I sourced much information from the cabinet papers. But they are not used to it. So I said: I understand, it's something new, and I know you don't like my interference and busybody checking up and so on. But under the Constitution it is my job to do that.""

4449,Career advice for SG PhD grad?,20,singapore,12us3qi,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/12us3qi/career_advice_for_sg_phd_grad/,49,"My recommendation would be to graduate. Don’t delay your graduation because of the program’s bad reputation. In academia, PIs dont hire you based on where you graduate from. They hire you based on your skill sets, whether u have published well and even who is ur PhD supervisor. In industry, they hire you mainly for ur relevant skills if it’s a related industry and also ur analytical training. Regardless of academia or industry, network is important.

Since you have identified that you want to go to industry, ask yourself what kind of roles are you interested in. Do you prefer sales, application specialists, R&D, project management, consultancy and etc. Narrow down where your interest lies and that should help you widen your job search. Talk to seniors that have joined industry to know more, attend networking sessions to build up connections and etc. Attend courses to work on your soft skills. Employers look out for soft skills too.

If your current PhD is too niche and there aren’t many job opportunities, then be prepared to go into a similar industry or even different industries within and outside SG. Be open minded.

Regarding pay, companies are willing to pay for PhDs. Of course, HR will try to offer you a lower salary. Just negotiate and ask for a reasonable amount. Look at annual package and not monthly pay since bonus/aws are variable. Good reading material: https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-01299-0

Good luck!"

4451,Career advice for SG PhD grad?,20,singapore,12us3qi,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/12us3qi/career_advice_for_sg_phd_grad/,49,"Unless you are looking for academic or R&D career pathways, PhD won't usually give you additional mileage in terms of pay for your first job, hence the notion of ""overqualified"". You can of course choose not to let that play to your disadvantage by not demanding for significant additional pay compared to other fresh hires as long as you know there are other benefits of joining that company (eg global network, lots of new domains to learn). 

In terms of the types of companies outside of the academia, there are options in defence, advanced manufacturing, aerospace, etc and it really depends on what you can bring onto the table with the knowledge you gained during your PhD. 

Frankly, I am surprised that you are asking such an open ended question with seemingly no clue to career choices after spending four years doing your PhD. Nowadays, we have young interns from polytechnics and universities already trying out different types of jobs during their industrial attachments and holidays, and building professional networks with the industries way before they graduate.

Response to your edit: Yes, it's alright to post in a colloquial manner in forums such as this or speaks colloquially with friends, we all do that from time to time. However, I am not sure if it will help you in your career if you are already accepting the fact that your current language ability is poor and hence you are in engineering. Sounds defeatist to me.

Next, in the tech domain, I don't think there is any future proof skill sets. I recently went back to coding so that I can get my much needed tech refresh."

Your domain knowledge won’t be directly useful but your ability to tackle ambiguous problems, define tasks, collaborate with others, etc. those are all extremely valuable skills. Most places don’t care that you have a PhD, they just care about what you learned in that process. You definitely need to spend a lot of time catching up on the basics and preparing though. Since your research was in computational field I’m assuming you know some programming already. 

Another idea is if you’re interested in moving overseas you can get a postdoc in that country as a way to get started and look for opportunities afterwards. Know many colleagues who have done this too."

If you do CFD simulations then it’s more than likely your programming skills are good. A job as a data scientist or data analyst would be right for you and pays better than a postdoc. If you have the programming foundations a couple of online courses to pick up SQL and data science would be sufficient for you to compete. 

If you want to do something close to research and am not prepared to leave the academic hamster wheel fully try going to AStar (which has a fluid dynamics department, so you’d fit in great) or DSO.

Considering that around 3 in 5 Singaporeans aged 20 to 39 have a degree and generally expect jobs which commensurate their qualifications, more higher paying jobs are certainly needed for us, especially the younger generation.

The difficulty lies in ensuring that the fruit of economic growth is fairly distributed, that it will not be merely a small segment which enjoys most of the benefits.

Swiss Defend $17BN AT1 Bond Wipeout In Credit Suisse Deal As Furious Creditors Including David Tepper Vow To Sue Switzerland  
BY TYLER DURDEN  
THURSDAY, **MAR 23, 2023** \- 10:03 PM

  
blah blah blah blah......  
  
That said, ***the additional tier 1 (AT1) bonds in question were warned as they contained explicit contractual language that they would be “completely written down in a ‘viability event’ in particular if extraordinary government support is granted”, Finma said.*** This allowed the regulator to prioritise equity holders ahead of AT1 holders. Furthermore, when AT1s were created as a hybrid debt instrument after the financial crash of 2008, their whole purpose was to give banks greater capital flexibility in the event of crises, and for the bonds to be bailed in in case of need.  
  
Meanwhile, the government's intervention to bail out the combined UBS-CS entity - because if Credit Suisse had gone under, UBS was certainly next - is undisputable: as part of the acquisition deal by UBS, the combined bank will receive CHF9BN of government guarantees and a CHF100bn liquidity lifeline from the SNB. An additional emergency government ordinance issued by Bern on Sunday had further confirmed the power to take decisions over elements of a bank’s capital structure in Swiss law, Finma said.  
  
***“\[The\] instruments in Switzerland are designed in such a way that they are written down or converted into \[equity\] before the equity capital of the bank concerned is completely used up or written down,” it said, pointing out that the bonds were designed for the use of sophisticated institutional investors because of their risky hybrid nature.***  
  
None of that however has helped ease the anger of bondholders who over one weekend saw their entire investment wiped out. Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan and Pallas Partners are among the law firms representing bondholders that have pledged to fight the Swiss decision. Quinn hosted a call on Wednesday joined by more than 750 participants.  
  
Partner Richard East told the Financial Times the deal was “a resolution dressed up as a merger” and pointed to statements by the European Central Bank and the Bank of England, which distanced themselves from the Swiss approach.  
  
""You know something has gone wrong when other regulators come and politely point out that in a resolution \[they\] would have respected ordinary priorities,"" he said.  
  
“If this is left to stand, how can you trust any debt security issued in Switzerland, or for that matter wider Europe, if governments can just change laws after the fact,” David Tepper, the billionaire founder of Appaloosa Management, told the Financial Times. “Contracts are made to be honored.”  
  
Tepper is among the most successful investors in troubled financial companies, famously making billions of dollars on a 2009 wager that US banks would not be nationalised during the last financial crisis. Appaloosa had bought a range of Credit Suisse’s senior and junior debt as the bank descended into chaos.  
  
Mark Dowding, chief investment officer at RBC BlueBay, which held Credit Suisse AT1 bonds, said Switzerland was “looking more like a banana republic”. His Financial Capital Bond fund is down 12.2 per cent this month.  
  
No matter how the lawsuits turn out, however, one thing is certain: Swiss banking as an industry that thrived and prospered for centuries, is effectively over and nobody will voluntarily either deposit or invest in Swiss banks after this catastrophically bundled government intervention. For the sake of what's left of the Swiss economy, we can only hope that the cheese and chocolate industries are not in need of bailouts."

Lawrence is the one that started this by saying WP still hasn't stated if they support the 7% gst til date. And I find this line of questioning weird. 

1) PAP say want to increase gst to 7%
2) WP say no
3) PAP increase anyway
4) PAP starts outspending the revenue

So after approving the 7% gst against the objection of WP and outspending the 7% gst... They want WP to state if WP is against 7% gst. 

It's like taking up a loan against your wife's wishes.. spending all the money on low resale value stuff and asking your wife if she wants to sell everything and be homeless to repay the loan in full now. Like wtf, you already dug the hole so deep that there is no turning back and now you ask."

Leon perera shouldve hit murali with the ""what is the point behind the question here"" lol. Wtf is murali on. Shanmugan drug test this man.

Also whats the point of asking about the ""gap in gst"". I just dont get it. Gst has been increased a couple of times. Not sure what is the point is asking the wp about what % of gst is fair. 

Everything i associate with murali pillai is ""why"".
Why did he ask this.
Why did he make a reference to a non existent video near election time.
Why is murali like this."

It's concerning that future-PM Lawrence Wong was the one leading the charge [by saying: ""For instance, the WP does not support the entire goods and services tax (GST) or the latest increase from 7 per cent to 9 per cent""](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/dpm-wong-calls-on-opposition-to-offer-serious-alternative-agenda-not-just-populist-ideas)


Anyone with a half-decent staff or 30 minutes to google can tell from the manifestos and Hansard records over the years that WP (or most opposition parties, for that matter) do not oppose the idea of the GST, only the increase in a time of pandemic and looming recession. Whether they're justified or not is another matter - the issue here is that ministers like Lawrence Wong and Ong Ye Kung, with resources at hand to be briefed on this, chose to portray this outdated stance as fact.

Imagine if LMW used the same tactic and accused PAP of eugenics, and said ""it's because we need clarity on what each party stands on important issues"". I bet he'll get slaughtered by everyone, not just the Parliament."

Mr Ong said that more than 80% of the cancer-stricken seek treatment in public hospitals. With an ageing population, this number can only go up. I conclude that they have foreseen a shortage of hospitals, hospital beds and medical staff, to take care of the failing health of the elderly. And they don't intend to do anything directly to mitigate the lack of these resources (such as building more polyclinics or hospitals). Therefore, all the other alternative suggestions about taking care of yourself and regulating the insurance companies. 

Of course, I may be completely wrong.

The fact that we still consider ourselves ""developing"" is why we aren't in OECD despite clearly qualifying for it.

To simplify things, this has got to do with responsibilities. The Paris Agreement has ""common but differentiated responsibilities"" in tackling climate change. So Annex I are clearly the developed countries (mainly OECD) while the rest are seen as ""developing"", such as the G77 of supposedly non-aligned states that date back to the (first) cold war. Qatar and the UAE are with us on this list. 

The problem is that if we say we're ready to go Annex I, our responsibility will be much higher and not only that, it will question our preferential status as ""developing country"" in other international fora. It would open up a new can of worms. This gov does not like to overcommit and would rather preserve flexibility in what SG can get/has to do. 

So I doubt that SG would actually seek funds meant for other SIDS, like the Pacific Islands, but it would certainly prefer that optionality to tap into it. BTW, some of the other SIDS are also quite buay song as to why we still caucus with them, because our interests clearly diverge with them in other aspects (""why is there a major oil hub among us?"")

> Ms Fu then asked to clarify whether Mr Perera was suggesting that Singapore move away from the Paris Agreement. But Mr Perera said that this was not the case and asked Ms Fu to explain why donating to the Loss and Damage Fund equates to deviating from the Paris Agreement.

But to insinuate that WP wants to pull SG of PA just because of one single track of the agenda is indeed a disgracefu straw man."

In this case for the Paris Agreement, there is a definition of what is a developed and what is not a developed country. Singapore happens to be in the developing country which correct me if I am wrong, means that we do not need to donate to the fund. Even if we want to, it's will require us to talk to alot of parties because there may be some countries who might not want developing countries like Singapore to donate for domestic/geo-political reasons"

Great that it works for you, but don't expect everyone to live the same way.

Personally, I think it's a social mobility problem. We live in a capitalistic society, where majority of people are inevitably going to want to buy nice things. When you rob them of that hope, that's when people are going to get angry. Telling them to spend less isn't just going to float. This discourse is proof enough.

Just because you lot like to live modestly doesn't mean everyone else does. And believe me, social mobility, or even just the perception of the lack of it for the broad middle class in SG, is going to be a big effing problem for the PAP. That isn't a citizen's job to solve. Nor is telling folks angry about not being able to get something, to simply stop wanting it.

It's amazing how a political elite like him doesn't know that

The PAP has many different voices and take in many different options, that's what public consultation is for. However once the leadership makes a decision, they have to stand by it. That's how a good system works. Even during LKY era you often hear of people like GKS having differing opinion. High profile cases in the past like whether to build the casinos or MRT are all widely known. The difference being after a decision is made, the party aligns itself to the same decision. 

Were mistakes ever made, of coz there are, but the PAP has never been shy on u turning when mistakes are made, e.g. The no mask policy during covid. It's not like countries with varying voices doesn't make mistakes, they do, the difference being our system is far superior because it allows for the leadership to make take drastic turns when require while in liberal democratic countries, such moves are impossible due to political pressure. The US is a fine example of this. E.g. Biden have oft repeat the trade war against China is a mistake, even after sanctions are applied, trade with China is still at a record high. It does nothing against the Chinese while pushing up inflation for the US yet he is unable to remove those sanction because of anti Chinese political pressure. 

Meanwhile the useless wp has a weak leader so when there are different voices within the party as with the case of lgbt, the party leader does not dare to take a position. In management, making no decision is usually as bad if not worse than making the wrong decision. This is why if PAP gets kicked out we are royally screwed"

Romero heads a research team that has studied the spider’s venom for seven years, prompted by tales of Chilean farmers who acquired superhuman virility after being bitten by the black widow.

Initial studies focused on taking extracts from the venom to treat erectile dysfunction, but they soon discovered it had a molecule that also made it an effective contraceptive.

“This is a great business opportunity, we are the creators of the spermicide,” Romero told Reuters by telephone.

He said he believes the molecule’s natural properties are superior to those of synthetic spermicides currently on the market.

“For us in Chile, this has opened a window of opportunity to an incredible market, since currently there are no naturally based spermicides that have the properties of this discovered molecule,” Romero said.

Romero, based at the Universidad de la Frontera in the southern city of Temuco, has already applied for a patent for his erectile dysfunction medicine.

His team discovered the property after looking into Chilean folklore that describes a virile man, one known to have spectacular sexual energy or many sexual partners, as being “spider-bitten.”

The Chilean black widow is also known as the wheat spider for the wheat fields it inhabits and where its farmer-victims receive their often fatal bite.

The spider’s bite can kill children and the elderly, but among strong young farmers it leads to erections that can last for days and involve involuntary ejaculations.

At the end of the ordeal, the man is left sexually energized and feels physically stronger, the saying goes.

Romero said he was confident his research would be complete in a couple of years and the spermicide would become available to world markets.

“We have to make sure there are no side effects ... so that it can be used as a gel in combination with condoms, or as suppositories for women.”"

Originally, the practice was to cut off the rival's nose. However, this happened when Justinian II was overthrown by his generals and, while in exile in Crimea, he had a golden nose forged for himself. He then married the sister of a Bulgarian khan and returned with an army by way of a dowry and took back his throne. Thus the practice of blinding, which was a bit more final, replaced nose-slicing as the preferred form of political mutilation."

Most of the passengers on this flight were Japanese.[1] TE24 was standing on the tarmac refueling when Ahmjed Ali, armed with dynamite explosives from a gold mine, boarded the aircraft. Ahmjed Ali, then aged 37, an ethnic Indian who worked as a refueler for Air Terminal Services, entered the flight deck and told to the captain that he was carrying dynamite and would blow up the aircraft if his demands were not met.

Using the plane's radio, he demanded the release of the deposed Fijian prime minister, Dr. Timoci Bavadra, and his 27 ministers who were being held under house arrest by rebel leader Lt. Col. Sitiveni Rabuka in the 1987 Fijian coups d'état. Ali also demanded to be flown to Libya.[2]

All 105 passengers and 21 of the 24 crew disembarked. Captain Graham Gleeson, flight engineer Graeme Walsh, and first officer Michael McLeay[3] remained with Ali in the cockpit. For six hours, Ali talked with relatives in the Nadi tower and Air New Zealand negotiators in Auckland.[4] Meanwhile, the New Zealand Special Air Service were placed on a state of ""preparedness.""[1]

At around 1 p.m., while Ali was distracted with the radio, flight engineer Walsh hit him with a bottle of whiskey. The crew members were able to overpower Ali and handed him over to local police. He received a suspended sentence for taking explosives onto an aircraft.[4]

Aftermath
Edit
Following the incident, New Zealand's Prime Minister, David Lange, said that he was ""grateful"" the incident was over. [1]

Ahmjed Ali later became a member the House of Representatives of Fiji in 1999. In 2014, Ali confirmed to the Dominion Post that he has been granted permanent residency in New Zealand since 2009. Immigration New Zealand refused to comment on the circumstances regarding the granting of his resident status. [5]

Captain Gleeson has said that he did not condone the hijacking, but was sympathetic to Ali.[5]"

A quick google of “french bat telomere study” turned up this about them from atlas obscura

> Bat species in the Myotis genus tend to intrigue researchers because they defy expectations. In general, “small things live fast and die young,” while “big things live slow and live long,” the biologist Emma Teeling, a professor at University College Dublin, told Motherboard. A mayfly lives a single day; a house mouse generally sees each season once; some whales have dipped fins in multiple centuries. Myotis bats upend this pattern: They weigh between two and 45 grams, and 13 species of them are known to live past their 20th birthdays. The combination of their petite size and long life is remarkable—out of all the mammals on the planet, these bats have the largest disparity between body mass and lifespan. Given its size, a 41-year-old Brandt’s bat, Myotis brandtii, lived roughly ten times longer than scientists might have guessed it would."

For DNA to replicate (in order for cells to divide), imagine you're watching a game of Floor Is Lava, but there is a safe rug spanning from the left to the right of your view. To reinforce the rug and keep it sturdy against lava, an employee has to reapply anti-lava coating to the surface--but since the floor is lava, that employee has to stand on the rug itself. The employee is also a little incompetent and can only walk backwards and cannot turn around. They start on the left side of the rug and walk backwards, applying the anti-lava coating. But when their heels hit the right edge of the rug, they stop to keep themselves from falling into lava--the rug is now shorter by the length of their shoe. Over multiple applications of the coating, the rug gets shorter and shorter until that shortening compromises the rug's ability to function.

The rug is DNA/a chromosome and that's a rough explanation of why the replication machinery cannot fully replicate the very ends of the DNA--or the telomeres.

Cancer cells do not have telomere shortening because they have an enzyme called telomerase that has the ability to add back some rug on the right-hand side/add DNA to the ends of chromosomes."

**Bumble Bee Foods settles for $6m in death of worker cooked with tuna**  


  
Bumble Bee Foods has agreed to pay $6m to settle criminal charges in the death of a worker who was cooked in an oven with tons of tuna.

  
District attorney Jackie Lacey said the settlement is the largest payout in a California workplace-violation death.  


  
Jose Melena, 62, died three years ago in a 270F oven at the seafood company’s Santa Fe Springs plant after a co-worker mistakenly believed he was in the bathroom and filled a pressure cooker with six tons of canned tuna.  


  
“This is the worst circumstances of death I have ever, ever witnessed,” said deputy district attorney Hoon Chun, who noted he had tried more than 40 murder cases over two decades. “I think any person would prefer to be – if they had to die some way – would prefer to be shot or stabbed than to be slowly cooked in an oven.”  


  
Bumble Bee, its plant operations director Angel Rodriguez and former safety manager Saul Florez had each been charged with three counts of violating Occupational Safety & Health Administration rules that caused a death.

  
Under the agreement, Bumble Bee will plead guilty to a misdemeanor of willfully failing to have an effective safety program in January 2017 if it completes several safety measures that include upgrading ovens so workers do not get trapped inside and providing worker training.  


  
“We will never forget the unfathomable loss of our colleague Jose Melena and we are committed to ensuring that employee safety remains a top priority at all our facilities,” the San Diego-based company said in a statement.

  
Florez, 42, of Whittier was sentenced to three years of probation and will face fines and penalties of about $19,000 after pleading guilty to a single felony count of violating a workplace safety rule that caused a death.  


  
Rodriguez, 63, of Riverside, agreed to plead guilty to a misdemeanor in 18 months and pay about $11,000 after he completes 320 hours of community service and worker safety courses.  


  
The two men had faced up to three years in prison and fines up to $250,000 and the company had faced fines up to $1.5m.  


  
Melena’s family will receive $1.5m under the settlement. It does not prevent them from also suing the company or receiving workers’ compensation funds, Hoon said.

  
Melena, 62, had been loading pallets of canned tuna into 35ft-long ovens at the company’s Santa Fe Springs plant before dawn on 11 October 2012.

  
When a supervisor noticed him missing, an announcement was made on the intercom and employees searched for him in the facility and parking lot, according to a report by the California division of occupational safety and health.

  
His body was found two hours later after the pressure cooker was turned off, cooled and opened.  


  
The state’s occupational safety agency previously cited Bumble Bee Foods for failing to properly assess the danger to employees working in large ovens and fined it $74,000.  


  
Melena’s family agreed to the settlement, but declined to comment, prosecutors said."

So emotions get suppressed consciously, which leads to unconscious repression, and people don't understand what's happening to them if they do feel emotions.

It was just the head of a six iron (interesting choice, not most peoples' go to club) that had been custom modified with an attachment to connect it to the sample collector they used.  He could pop that head onto the end of the shaft and boom...golf club.

Had to swing it one handed because the suit is too restrictive to allow a two handed grip and swing, that's why it took a couple tries to hit one cleanly.

And the ""miles and miles and miles"" thing was just for TV.  he's said in later interviews he didn't hit it that hard and figured it just went maybe 300 yards.   That's also been looked at and some people reviewing the evidence thing it's possible it went as little as 40 yards.

I don't personally have that much trouble believing either.  With no air resistance and low gravity, if you get under it it's really going to fly.  But it's also pretty unlikely you're goign to hit it that well so just giving it a little tap and then it immediately digs into the ground like a sand trap....40 yards doesn't sound unlikely either."

Aos sí (pronounced [iːsˠ ˈʃiː]; older form: aes sídhe [eːsˠ ˈʃiːə]) is the Irish name for a supernatural race in Celtic mythology – spelled sìth by the Scots, but pronounced the same – comparable to fairies or elves. They are said to descend from either fallen angels or the Tuatha Dé Danann, meaning the ""People of Danu"", depending on the Abrahamic or pagan tradition.
Aos sí are seen as fierce guardians of their abodes —whether a fairy hill, a fairy ring, a special tree (often a hawthorn) or a particular loch or wood. It is believed that infringing on these spaces will cause the aos sí to retaliate in an effort to remove the people or objects that invaded their homes. Many of these tales contribute to the changeling myth in west European folklore, with the aos sí kidnapping trespassers or replacing their children with changelings as a punishment for transgressing. The aos sí are often connected to certain times of year and hours; as the Gaelic Otherworld is believed to come closer to the mortal world at the times of dusk and dawn, the aos sí correspondingly become easier to encounter. Some festivals such as Samhain, Bealtaine and Midsummer are also associated with the aos sí.

They were swiftly cut up, while those who obeyed were released and left alone. Also among those who were led to the throne was Dózsa's brother, who did not even have the luxury of eating his brother alive, and was instead chopped into three pieces. 

György's death, and the brutal torture of 40.000 rebels who took part in the revolt, may have aided the Ottoman forces during their 1526 invasion, as the Hungarians were no longer a politically united people. The result was that for the next few centuries, Hungary was partitioned between the Ottoman Empire, the Hapsburg monarchy, and the Principality of Transylvania."

[...] But Dózsa's desire for glory was growing, and his fellow soldiers tried in vain to dissuade him from challenging the feared Ottoman champion Ali of Epeiro to a duel. Ali was the leader (Bey) of the Ottoman Spahi cavalry from castle of Szendrő (now Smederevo Serbia), who had already caused the death of many Hungarian valiants during his duels. Ali immediately accepted the challenge, the duel was held on the field between Nándorfehérvár and Szendrő on 28 February 1514. After a desperate long but fierce struggle, Dózsa slowly managed to overcome his opponent, he cut off one of Ali's arm, and finally killed the Ottoman champion. With this victory, Dózsa won a nation-wide reputation and fame. For this brave deed, György Dózsa was knighted by King Valdislaus. He also got a fancy gold chain which depicted his victory, and the king donated him with a village.

Basically PCOS is a reproductive and metabolic disorder with symptoms that include increased testosterone, insulin problems (mainly insulin resistance), etc. it also results in typically irregular periods. One of the recommended diets for people with PCOS is low carb and lower calorie. This led to one possible theory on how the disease arose which basically goes like this 

In times of abundance, people with PCOS are more likely to experience symptoms and might have a harder time ovulating regularly, which results in fertility issues. But in times of scarcity and decreased access to foods and especially carbs, the same people with PCOS might have continued to ovulate when non-PCOS women stopped. Basically operating as a failsafe to produce offspring. 

I have PCOS and every time I’ve done a low carb diet and incorporated more rigorous exercise, I’ve gotten a period within a few weeks. 

It might not be THE answer to why PCOS exists but it sure is interesting."

Most things are printed using a combination of four inks, CMYK, cyan, magenta, yellow, and black. However it's hard to keep the printed color constant and areas with heavier distributions of some colors or combinations will affect other areas. The Pantone system creates a specific recipe for a specific color, and that color is printed on a 5th plate so there's minimal interaction with the other inks.

Most brands use Pantone colors as it's the only way to reproduce the same color the way each time, usually for a logo. In this case, they reproduced the purple from Prince's piano and that specific shade of purple, using the Pantone recipe, will be used in the future in regards to all official Prince merchandise."

The drinker eventually becomes impaired by drinking and can't maintain the functions of life (work, school, child-rearing, family gatherings, etc.). The enabler helps the drinker to continue to drink in a myriad of ways by making excuses, telling lies, being the go-between for the drinker with other people, sometimes buying alcohol, generally covering up the bad consequences of drinking. Thereby, the enabler enables the drinker to drink. As long as that person continues to enable, the drinker will not enter recovery. The drinker never hits the point where they either stop drinking or die.

The reasons? Shame, fear, pity, habit, dysfunctional family dynamics.

The enabler has to get treatment as well. Alanon is specifically designed for the family and loved ones of alcoholics.

I understand that hoarding basically means not wanting to throw things out and that it seriously impacts the lives of the hoarder and others that may live there. I get that it’s a mental illness. But I don’t see how it starts with leaving crap on the floor like in the pictures. If the pictures showed piles of things like newspapers on a bench getting bigger and bigger then that’d be different. Most hoarders try to keep things neat until they just have too much. Those pictures show a lazy inhabitant who was messy before the hoarding got too much."

Video by Dr. Jason Fung, explaining a paradigm shift in the way we think about cancer.

Cancer is caused by ***chronic*** injury to a cell. If the injury was acute, the cell would just die. If there's no injury, then there's no reason for the cell to perform poorly.

But something like skin cancer, with constant exposure to the sun in a way where the body fails to protect itself, can cause cancer. As does years of smoking for lunch cancer.

So carrying something in the same spot, year after year, where the heat and friction damage the skin - fit with the paradigm of chronic sub-terminal injury to the cells"

On Monday, around 4:30 p.m., police say a 62-year-old man was walking his dog near 20th and Chew streets when two freely roaming pit bulls approached his dog. They say the bigger of the two pit bulls began attacking his dog and the man attempted to pull the dogs apart, but the pitbull kept biting his dog. That’s when he shot twice at the larger dog, killing it. The other dog ran off into a nearby alley. The man brought his dog, who had injuries on his paws and eye, inside his house on 21st Street. He said he then spotted an officer who was patrolling the area near 21st and Conlyn streets, just north of La Salle University, and approached him, telling the cop he had just fatally shot a freely roaming, large pit bull who had attacked his smaller dog.  The man told the 14th District Police Officer, James Edmiston, that he had a permit to carry and his gun was on his waistband. Edmiston, 50, said, in response, that the firearm first needed to be secured, then they could go tend to the dog. The man obliged. As the dog owner had his hands above his head, and the officer was trying to secure the firearm, police say the gun went off, and the man was shot in the leg. Edmiston then drove the man to the hospital, where he is expected to physically recover.

Police say Edmiston is now on desk duty, pending the outcome of an investigation by the District Attorney’s office and the Officer Involved Shooting Investigation group."""

Next tier should be limited capacity magazine or tube fed fed weapons. Pump action shotguns and the like. Getting licensed for these would be like getting a motorcycle license where you have to do some extra training and complete a practical exam in a course.

Then you have unlimited round capacity weapons, and that should be like getting a CDL. You have to take tactical, live fire training courses. Like something an actor would do, or about the same amount of weapons training they give cops during their police academy. Remember, in police academy they cover a wide range of subjects during the 10 to 25 weeks. I'm talking about only the tactical weapons training portion.

Most responsible gun owners would do what it takes oto get licensed on their own. Others would bury their weapons in the backyard or something and pretend they got rid of them. Either way, is fine and over time people would become licensed or they would lose their weapons, as we've already seen with automatic weapons."

Politicians are having too much fun promoting fear and division, marginalizing minorities, violating rights, and promoting overzealous police.  

For decades now, I have seen scientific studies that say treatment is more cost effective than incarceration for reducing addiction.  But politicians just throw ever more people in jail for ever longer sentences instead of funding treatment services.  There’s always room at the jail for addicts and there’s always a shortage of space at treatment facilities.  And once you’re in a county jail, there’s basically no treatment help whatsoever.  State prisons offer a little help but not much.  Government would rather punish addicts than treat them because that promotes the incremental nefarious rise of government dominance.   

Last I checked, legal drugs cause more overdose deaths than illegal drugs.  Zero overdose deaths are attributed to cannabis while many thousands are caused by alcohol.  If politicians wanted to reduce addiction deaths, cannabis would be legal while alcohol would be discouraged.  But that’s not the case because it would reduce the profits of alcohol, tobacco, pharmaceutical, and prison industries.   

Part of the problem with fentanyl is that people don’t know how much they’re getting.  That makes overdose deaths more likely.  If addicts could replace unlabeled illegal drugs with medical quality drugs and safe injection sites, crime, addiction, disease and overdoses would all drop.  Again, sensible changes don’t happen because politicians want to pretend to address addiction but instead want to keep addiction going because that promotes the gradual loss of liberty and the concentration of fascist power.   

Hopefully people will wake up to the demons and put honest candidates in political office.   

Speaking of demons, I just watched the movie Nefarious with a recently released prisoner.   It was cool.  Also on the demon note, check out the cover of Iron Maiden’s the number of the beast.   The super rich are pulling the strings of politicians who are pulling the strings of “criminal justice” who are causing havoc across the earth.  

Arise, oh my people arise!"

It's pointless to deny that some unsocialized online men are in a global internet subculture where it's okay to commit acts of terrorism over minor slights - doxxing, swatting, etc. Go look at the replies to War Thunder begging people to stop sending them classified material, there are gamers insisting that they wouldn't ""have"" to get the company in trouble with classified documents if they'd just fix the design/balance the gameplay. That is insanely entitled, stupid behavior. 

Obviously not all unsocialized young men do this, the vast majority just want to get their mythic keys in in peace, and all teenagers and stupid young people get aggro over nothing and react impulsively, and it's not so much a problem of ""gaming"" as of the antisocial behavior of angry young men, expressed in a shared hobby, but it is relevant for law enforcement to look at gaming culture and communication platforms as vectors for violence and national security leaks. The girlies on Tumblr aren't leaking, the bitter old queens on Datalounge aren't leaking, but a small percentage of the gamers on discord are. The good news is that's not your problem if you're not posting classified material. If someone around you posts illegal material you can anonymously report to the FBI and forget about it."

6174,Joasia Zakrzewski: Ultrarunner who used car says she made massive error,0,nottheonion,12td4yx,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-65322631,17,"Error? 

 Hmm. I've a history of drinking heroic quantities of hard liquor, and smoking herb as if possessed by the spirit of Bob Marley. I have made errors. However, those errors were made within the realms of attempting to correctly perform a task. For example, I fell asleep on the toilet once, after a particularly heavy vomiting episode, caused by massive over indulgence in rum. I did, however, leave the toilet spotless, despite having no recollection of cleaning up and technically being in an alcohol induced state of undeath at the time. When baked out of my mind at a festival on some of the finest herb to hit the shores of England, I got lost behind my own tent for four hours. Those were errors.  

 However... 

 There seems a pretty massive difference between making errors, and making a free will decision to cease honestly competing in a footrace, and boarding a motor conveyance, for the purpose of bypassing some of the route, not to mention violating the rules of the footrace. That is less of an error, and more of a blatant attempt to cheat, and as an experienced fuck up, I'd like to state that I take this misrepresentation as a personal affront. We fuck ups and error familiar types work hard to make our balls ups, accidents and mistakes as spectacular, decrepit and comical as possible, for our own amusement and that of our fellow human beings. We don't BENEFIT from them, we don't TRY to. We just hilariously fail at things! This though? Not cool."

One time my friends and I were camping in Tofino. We had a non-provincial park campsite around Canada Day, and set up a bunch of tents and had our food stored properly away. We knew there was a bear in the area, an adolescent friendly guy, but we knew he would be up to no good so we made sure we took precautions. We put all the food up, leaving a couple coolers full of beer on the ground in the camp site.  
  
The first night I'm sleeping in a tiny tent being awoken to the bear sniffing my face. I accidentally left my tent open for some drunken reason. I quickly pull away, and scare the creeper bear away.  
  
The next night he didn't bother us, but watched from a distance as we drank and partied. We stayed vigilant about our food spoils, and made sure he couldn't come back into any of our tents.  
  
The last night was when the bear struck.  
  
We awoke that morning to a mangled cooler. But what was odd was what was taken and what was not. We had two types of beer - Kokanee and Canadian. ALL of the Kokanee was drank, and only 1 Canadian had been touched. I have no idea why. I can't even tell the difference. From that day on, I know that bears not only care about drinks from cans, they have preferences.

I feel like if people understood how dictionaries work, this would all go much more smoothly.

Dictionaries record usage. They don't take dictation from God-- they write down how words are being used at the moment. 

Definitions are listed (to the best of lexicographers' abilities) in order of their frequency of usage. 

Getting mad at the dictionary over words you don't like is like getting mad at the post office for delivering mail you don't like. They give you what comes down the pipe-- they aren't (to the best of their abilities) taking a position on any issue."
