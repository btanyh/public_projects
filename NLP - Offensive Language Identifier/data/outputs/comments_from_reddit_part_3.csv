This is honestly best case scenario. If there is an inadvertent slide deployment out on the open tarmac/runway, it would ground the aircraft and cost between 60-100k to fix.

If it happened whilst bridged, there is a high probability of fatality for someone on the bridge or on the ramp in the general vicinity.

Also to the filmer if you're smart enough park in a way to not cause gridlock traffic then you're smart enough to realize this guy in front of you is going to merge.

You can imagine his surprise when he is honked at given the circumstances. It's like a roller coster of emotions. [Like when you think your homies got you an iphone for your wedding gift but it's an empty box.](https://youtu.be/YskR7AICBs4).

The only thing the merger could of done differently was made eye contact with the filmer and gave the filmer the ""Thank you bro."" Wave. Which is usually any hand gesture showing appreciation.

Edit: for all those suggesting that they had driven down an empty lane and were trying to cut in at the end, or that by giving way to this one vehicle means that you must give way to every vehicle:

No! You can clearly see in the background that the traffic is at a standstill across at least 3 lanes. 

The fact that the passenger is shouting to ‚Äúgo‚Äù, clearly means they are trying to block the other vehicle.

I‚Äôm saying by letting one vehicle in, you lose effectively no time, that doesn‚Äôt mean you let every vehicle in.

We don‚Äôt know if this is the first vehicle trying to merge or the 50th, but going by the behaviour of the passengers I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs closer to the first.

I‚Äôm pretty anti creating new laws most of the time, but the amount of people who can‚Äôt properly take care of their dogs and let them bark 24/7 is unacceptable.

It must get annoying having strangers grab you and touch you like that.  Ask for a picture if you want that badly.  If they say no just move on.  He can't just stand there for two hours taking pictures with every single person.  In the full video he was being really patient and taking several people's phones from the stands above to take pics for them.   Just because someone is famous doesn't mean they have to automatically take pics or talk to you.

When I go to the post office I always have to have the person behind the counter help me with addressing the envelope and luckily they are always very accommodating. If this woman was simply asking for help with something she couldn't do or understand on her own and the person behind the counter refused to help or copped an attitude about it than the fit is a little more justified.

Basically a computer was acting up and it had to be shipped back to the company which happened to be Amsterdam.

As some of you may know, international packages require certain things, paperwork etc.

The package was prepared to the exact specifications according to the USPS website.

My local USPS office declined to ship it as it was and demanded it be shipped a different way (can‚Äôt recall the shipping type but they said it didn‚Äôt come with insurance). This is important.

So I refused to allow them to do that, I printed the website directly and brought the package back and asked for a supervisor.
I had her direct line and she assured me if anything happens that I can call her directly.

The package never arrived. I called to complain.

She told me that because the package option I selected did not come with insurance I can‚Äôt file a claim.

I was livid. She even admitted she knows it was on the postal worker but there was nothing that could be done.

It‚Äôs probably still floating around in between Amsterdam and the US. 

The only way I could realistically get my money back is by literally suing the federal government for the $200 cost."

He then quickly re-entered the store, he threw a sloppy haymaker which she efficiently ducked. In one motion, she countered with a right hook across the jaw. The man resorts to hair pulling - vs. a woman (how sad) before he gladly gives up. And that, ladies and gentlemen, was the fight of the night."

Our agreement is if anyone ever comes in the store acting like a fucking animal and tries to hit or otherwise harm one of us (unless they have a gun of course) we are going to jump their asses 100%. You came in our house and started shit, we are gonna stomp you out as a team.

Edited to add: I've been doing this shit job for over 18 years. It takes a certain kind of person. You have to be able to see trouble before it starts, and you gotta be able to handle it when it does, because it will. We deal with the absolute worst scumbags the community has to offer, and we make shit money for it. Don't fuck with us we are already on edge."

Movie production stops if the actors aren't on set.  That means *everyone* working on the set suddenly has their job put on pause until the actors can return.

So what was the production company supposed to do?  Tell 300+ crew members ""well, you're out of a job, fuck off until Jamie feels better!""?  That's your preference here?  That the company pause everything, screw over hundreds of people, so that they don't ""replace"" Jamie?

Or should the company find a way to keep those hundreds of people employed for the rest of the shoot?  

There are plenty of examples of shitty companies not giving a crap about their employees and replacing them at the drop of a hat.

Life goes on when you aren't around. That's not a bad thing. That has nothing to do with capitalism or work. It's just how the world works.

Was Foxx under severe pressure from the production company to complete the project, possibly contributing to the stroke or was this one of those things that just happens?

Was Foxx paid the same as if he completed the project or did he forfeit earnings because of the stroke?

Depending on the answer to those two questions this is either a strong example of a glaring problem in our society or this says absolutely nothing about anything."

A) There is no way of knowing if Jamie Foxx will ever fully recover from the stroke.  It could be months or even years before he is in a position to resume filming, if they had decided to postpone production to wait for him.

B) A film production involved hundreds of contract workers that are not just going to sit around for 6 months waiting for Jamie to recover.  They are going to find other jobs and putting the entire production back together may not ever be possible due to scheduling complications.  Would you have preferred if they just abruptly laid off several hundred technical workers because the star of the movie was unavailable?  Staff that might have been relying on the pay from the final 8 days of filming?  Or would you prefer they evaluate the possibility of completing as much filming as possible using a stunt double?"

No one, including the studios, and producers wanted to go on without him. But they scheduled out the days for the shoot and contracted this massive crew for the time before anything happened.

Large film sets could be losing millions per day for every day they can not continue. All film crew, actors, camera men, stunt doubles, assistants, caterers, drivers, etc are still getting paid. Locations have been reserved for specific days.  Not to mention actors may have a tight budget in time and may be contracted to begin filming a new movie after this one is done. With the film nearly done not only actors but probably most, if not all, the crew had other jobs to start after they were done.

My degree was journalism and working at a new station was a low paying job, $12/hr with a degree. I was also working at the boys and girls club in the late afternoon. I realized I enjoyed working with youth and eventually became a youth probation officer bc it paid so well, $35/hr. That journey was 4 years.
Eventually, I was hired at a software startup doing customer service bc my journalism degree meant I could communicate and apply my marketing side hustle to their blog and help articles.
I am still at the same job, doing software QA checks bc I am very detailed oriented and can create user stories with minimal cuatomer feedback. Things get fixed faster bc I don't have to wait for a lot of feedback.
If you would have asked me 10 years ago if I would be doing software QA I would have said, I wasn't smart enough.

Some people may hate this idea but if you look at how most of the world lives, they don‚Äôt live by themselves or with one other person in a 1 bd apt. 
Consumerism/capitalism has convinced us that living with a several other people and sharing living spaces and other items is beneath us and should only happen in the 3rd world.  You can live a happy and prosperous life with other people but we are conditioned to be disgusted by and untrusting of other people living in close proximity.  

Living with 4-5 other people in a 3bd 2bath house was vital to my survival during and after college.  I was paying around $300/month for rent during the 2010s.  When I was finally able to afford my own apartment, I was excited about it and soon became depressed after moving in.  Most personality types do not thrive living alone.  But for some reason having your own place is the ideal, and when it makes us more depressed, the solution is to work more and buy more stuff.  

I know it is hard to find people to be comfortable living with and many people want to avoid all the BS and drama that can happen with roommates but finding good people is so much better mentally and financially than living alone."

Had a very similar experience with life after graduating.

I think the issue is the messaging we receive. Like me personally, I went to public schools within one of the smaller cities in Tennessee. We were told from 5th grade that if we ever wanted to make anything of ourselves that we had to go to college. They also made it seem like you weren‚Äôt intelligent or like your opinion would carry less weight if you didn‚Äôt have one.

Look at these stats that say a person coming out of college makes X amount higher than the one that doesn‚Äôt! And sure, I guess in theory it pays for itself in the long term but that‚Äôs not the message we received as kids. Might have been more helpful to show what areas of study correlated with dollar values but everything is hindsight in 20/20.

Either way, I‚Äôve been burned by the college experience and refuse to force my son to go like my parents did to me. It‚Äôs taken me roughly 10 years after graduating to make a decent wage and that was years and years of credit card spending because I couldn‚Äôt get by on wage alone. Oh, and a second job waiting tables.

Bottom line, my opinion is this: if you want to go for the sake of the experience, go for it. If you want to make money, get a degree in computer science, law, medical, or something similar. I‚Äôm rocking a business degree and it sucked hard for those years of suffering.

Last point: I‚Äôm sure there are people that go in with minimal debt and come out making bank after. People like me that grew up a bit poor but wanted the promise at a better life, do your own research because your mileage will vary. I‚Äôve accepted the fact that I might not ever own a home, but maybe I can use my experience to build a better life for my son to inherit when I kick it. Making his life easier than I had it would be a life worth living."

Ms. Shapiro‚Äôs experience highlights a particular challenge for companies and workers navigating return-to-office tensions: The career penalty for remote work may be greatest for women, young people and people of color, who often lack the professional networks that being in the office can help provide. But numerous surveys find that those same groups of workers are also the ones who value flexible arrangements the most, and who are the least likely to return to the office voluntarily.

‚ÄúThose who want remote work ‚Äî those who will likely take advantage of remote work ‚Äî are likely those who will lose jobs or at least lose out on opportunities because of remote work,‚Äù said Kweilin Ellingrud, a director of the McKinsey Global Institute who has studied how remote work affects career development.

Worse, Ms. Ellingrud said, the price of flexibility may not be obvious to workers or companies until years later, when disparities in pay or promotion emerge.

Take Jackiez Gonzalez, 36, who works remotely in social impact for Best Buy, and signed up for a mentoring program for employees of color. She was told that participants would gather regularly to discuss career development. But she learned a month after signing up that she‚Äôd been accidentally left off the calendar invitations for meetings.

‚ÄúWhen you‚Äôre remote, you‚Äôre out of sight, out of mind,‚Äù Ms. Gonzalez said of the experience, adding that while she has largely felt positive about her flexible work arrangements, ‚Äúthere are growing pains.‚Äù

The intangible benefits of in-person work have been challenging for researchers to study because they are, by definition, hard to measure. Existing studies of remote work have tended to focus on call centers or similar workplaces where productivity is easy to define and measure ‚Äî but where creativity, collaboration and mentorship may be less important.

Ms. Emanuel and her colleagues focused on software engineers at a Fortune 500 technology company, which the researchers had agreed not to identify. Before the pandemic, some engineering teams at the company were working in the same building, holding meetings in person and interacting with colleagues in the cafeteria. Other teams were split between buildings and held most of their meetings online to avoid the 20-minute walk across the company‚Äôs campus.

The economists were able to measure feedback by looking at the number of comments that engineers made on one another‚Äôs code ‚Äî a routine and essential form of interaction at most software companies. They found that before the pandemic, engineers working in the same building received 21 percent more feedback than those working in different buildings. Once the pandemic hit, and everyone worked remotely, the feedback gap virtually disappeared, suggesting it had been physical proximity ‚Äî not some other difference between the groups ‚Äî that had led to greater feedback for in-person teams.

The ‚Äúpower of proximity,‚Äù as the researchers call it in their paper‚Äôs title, was particularly large for newly hired engineers, younger workers and women. Engineers under age 30, for example, tended to receive more feedback, especially from their more experienced colleagues ‚Äî but only if they were all in the same building.

‚ÄúThese effects are really concentrated,‚Äù Ms. Emanuel said. ‚ÄúThe folks who really benefit the most from being in person are junior engineers and also are younger. Those are the groups that you might imagine have the most to learn.‚Äù

Notably, engineers ‚Äî especially younger workers and women ‚Äî who had previously been on teams that were all in the same building were more likely to quit their jobs once the pandemic sent everyone home. There was no such surge in departures among people who had previously worked on teams spread across multiple buildings. That suggested workers missed in-person interactions, Ms. Emanuel said.

The challenge for companies is that remote work has also brought real benefits for many employees, particularly for working parents and others juggling responsibilities at work and at home. In a survey from FlexJobs, the remote job search site, 60 percent of women and 52 percent of men said they would consider looking for a new job if they could no longer work remotely; 62 percent of women and 56 percent of men said better work-life balance was a benefit of remote work.

‚ÄúEmployee sentiment on remote work is crystal clear,‚Äù said Reyhan Ayas, senior economist at Revelio Labs, which collects and analyzes job postings, layoff notices and other work force data. ‚ÄúEmployees, if they are able to work from home, would like to work from home.‚Äù


For some white-collar knowledge workers, working in the office plays an important role in early-career development.

Many companies have embraced a hybrid model, permitting some employees to work remotely while allowing or requiring others to be in the office. Still, the ‚Äúpower of proximity‚Äù paper calls that approach into question: The economists found that the benefits of in-person work apply only when an entire team is physically together.

‚ÄúIf you have even one remote teammate, that can still result in less collaboration between the remaining teammates,‚Äù Ms. Emanuel said.

Still, many hybrid-work experts maintain that companies can find inventive ways of supporting their remote workers. There are even technologies emerging to enable that, including Gatheround, a videoconferencing platform that, among other functions, ensures all meeting participants get equal time to speak ‚Äî by cutting people off once they‚Äôve gone on longer than their colleagues. Lisa Conn, Gatheround‚Äôs chief executive, advises companies offering flexible work to have in-person attendees, even if some are together in the same space, join hybrid meetings on their own laptops.

Back at Verkada, Ms. Becker attributes parts of her growth at work to the time she has spent in the office. She has become a more critical manager, comfortable with prompting her 19 sales representatives to discuss ways they need to improve.

‚ÄúWhen I came in as a manager, I was everybody‚Äôs biggest cheerleader,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWhat I struggled with is having tough conversations.‚Äù

She made the shift because of advice she got from her own boss, who sits next to her: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs having a mentor tell you ‚Äî ‚ÄòHey, you gave that feedback. Are they implementing it?‚Äô‚Äù

And I can tell you, some people do not work well in a remote scenario, and part of that really is supervision. One of my employees productivity went way down once he went remote. He was fine in the office, but once people weren't looking over his shoulder, he became a slacker. A guy I hired at basically the same time, thrived with remote work, was at least as productive if not more.

These kinds of things are all personality based, you can't really generalize them and when you collect a data set, the data set might point to something but it's certainly not true for everyone and I would hope that not everyone gets all butt hurt because as it turns out, some people are worse workers when they're remote.

1. The obvious starting point is to talk to him. Tell him you've noticed you're being underpaid, show him copies of your payslips and your copies of your original contract, and ask him to fix it. Go into it assuming it's a genuine mistake (even if you know it isn't), and one that you're sure he wants to fix without any fuss.
2. If he refuses, delays, or outright gaslights you, then it's time to move onto the threats. Start by threatening to report the company to whatever the wage theft organisation is in your part of the world (DoL, ACAS, etc. etc.), and again, see what the response is.
3. Write a letter to the head of personnel, or equivalent, at your employer. As in, a literal dead tree letter, sent via recorded delivery so you have a record. Inform them that unless the matter is resolved by <reasonable date>, you will have no choice but to pursue the matter legally. They will almost certainly settle, if your evidence is as watertight as you claim it is.

**His wife's cancer treatments aren't at risk at all**. The whole point of incorporation - in most jurisdictions - is to separate the legal entities of the business from its owners. So even if you took legal action against the company, it's unlikely to have any effect on his family personally.

Moreover, if you do pursue legal action, you'll likely get your missing pay back, and he'll have to pay a moderate fine. If he has a few hundred employees, a couple of years of $1.50 payments isn't going to break the company's bank, and even a moderate fine isn't going to destroy them. And if he has several businesses, those are almost certainly separate legal entities, so in the unlikely event the fine really did bankrupt one company, the others would be totally unaffected.

Obviously, you should also look for a new job, because your workplace is going to be a horrible place to work once this process starts."

1)OP is diligent enough to photocopy his employment paperwork but not double-check his paystubs through half a year.

2)Father-in-law wouldn't need to tell ""hr"" to remain silent or lose their job. The payrate is on the paystubs, there is no being silent here it's legally being told to OP via those stubs. Plus they're allowed to legally change payrates, the threat of silence does nothing. No HR person would even actually care. Outside of story purposes the difference between $13.50 and $15.00 is so minor that any actual HR person wouldn't even remember it. They'd be processing dozens of employees so someone making close to minimum simply isn't that noteworthy.

3)Why would OP go to ""hr"" and not his father-in-law who they presumably see often?  Or his wife who typically would have a ""good in""?

4)OP is so out of their depth that they have their numbers way wrong. The amount is so small that suing would be small claims as 6 months at 1.50 is going to be like $1800 gross.

Family may not always be the first people to screw you over when it comes to money, but their betrayal will be the worst. When my grandfather died when I was in 3rd grade, the aftermath tore my otherwise closely knit, deeply religious and southern family on my mother's side completely apart. Trust was lost and it wasn't regained until well over 10 years later. So much time lost due to greed. Your own blood will fuck you over if there's enough money involved, and don't ever think that they wont. People shouldn't forget this. At a time when a family should come together and support each other, rest assured they're still curious about what sort of scraps will be left, and how much of it will be theirs. And whatever they think SHOULD be theirs, they will come for.

You have a personal obligation to correctly report your income (whether cash or not) accurately. That doesn't change because some people under report tips intentionally. 

The IRS is very taxpayer friendly and very sympathetic to workers. Their only objective is to have you pay the appropriate amount in tax. Typically, if you have under reported, and make it good, you will pay whatever you should have paid, say that you didn't check your employer's W-2 calculation, so there is no criminal intent, some minor interest and maybe a small penalty. Then they go after your employer for your half of payroll taxes and the payroll taxes for everyone who has ever worked for them with a higher expectation of diligence since they are an employer (which as a happy side effect makes everyone get more social security money later). 

I advise you to get your taxes in order and if you have evidence that your W-2 is short then get the IRS to hunt down your employer. If this triggers audits for your coworkers, then they need to sort out their taxes too (which everyone should do anyway because why do you want that hanging over you). If criminal intent is involved, consult a lawyer in all cases.

M: You need to express yourself creatively like your father. It's okay to have fun. 

Me: I won $500 in a rap beat contest.

M: No, you didn't. 

Me: Yes, I did.

I worked for a company once, and got ""the call"" one Friday. My boss peeked around to my cube, and asked me to come in to an office, and my VP, HR, and he was there. I knew this wasn't going to be a good day...  


I was told my services were no longer needed, but I had 2 months to find a job within the company. Some of us got this offer, others (such as our System Ops folks) were given their notice, and two weeks pay, and escorted out the door.

Just started my third year as a scaffolder at his company, never taken a holiday, and only one sick day in that time. He had me acting as lead hand (number two on a crew behind foreman) for the past six months. As well as a truck driver.
He felt like I didn't warrant a raise. I felt I didn't need to keep working for him.
I was only making $2 an hour more than idiots off the street.
Just a monumentally cheap bastard. We only worked one day the week before Christmas due to icy conditions. So we only got paid 4-1/2 hours for Christmas.
Had a guy drop a 4ft piece of steel on my face last april. I had a slight skull fracture and concussion. He calls me as I'm on the way to the hospital and says he hopes I get stitched up and back to work that day. When he filled out paperwork for compo he didn't put my truck driving time so I was on half pay instead of 2/3 the two weeks I was off."

Because of their bad reputation, they were miserably understaffed, so they only ‚Äútrained‚Äù me for 2 days before throwing me on the floor. 

On my fifth shift, I walked by a patient room to find a frail lady on the floor with a swollen wrist. This woman was supposed to have had a pressure alarm underneath of her, which is a pad that goes under the sheets that makes a loud sound when pressure is removed from it, so you can prevent falls by responding immediately, but the aide I was working with hadn‚Äôt placed it when she‚Äôd put the woman to bed. I got the nurse, she did her assessment, and we sent the woman to the ER for a suspected (and later confirmed) broken wrist.

The next day, I came in and was immediately met by the nursing supervisor to be pulled into her office. She told me that I was to receive a write-up for negligence, for not having placed the pressure alarm beneath that woman. I told her that I hadn‚Äôt put the woman to bed, my coworker had. She informed me that this nursing home Ms policy was to specifically assign residents to a specific aide, and this woman was on my assignment that evening, so I was responsible‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶ except when they trained me, no one informed me I had a specific assignment, but rather that the aides worked together on one hallway, and took whoever they took. I refused to sign the write-up, told them to kiss my ass, and walked out immediately.

I learned that nursing home closed down for safety violations due to severe understaffing about 8 months after I left.

Never felt better about leaving a place."

put in my two weeks because i was making below minimum wage and had been offered a job at $3 more an hour. i had only been there for about a month, figured they expected it. never showed up late for a shift, never called out. 

they scheduled me a clopen, by myself, after i received no training in regards to my responsibilities. i was under the impression i would be supervised during this period, but upon my arrival there was one manager available in the store 

i had to figure out how to unload, process, and price out an entire freezer truck load of product. i had no login information, nor the equipment or knowledge to do so

i got ahold of a store manager and asked for assistance. they asked why i was scheduled if i didn't know how to do my job. i answered and said this was my schedule and i follow it, but still need help as i haven't received training allowing me to complete my tasks. their response? 

""well you're scheduled so figure it out""

i said, ""okay,"" and clocked out. never went back, left a nice fuck you note on the store manager's desk for good measure"

I did? Weird, no one mentioned it to me. And why do I still have email and phone access if I quit? 

So what happened is I had been ""on loan"" to a different region for a couple months. I was staying in a hotel, and between projects it was at my own expense. But it was a 15 hour trip home. I asked several times for a new project, I had all the receipts in my email and text messages. After 2 weeks without work I told the supervisor I was going home, but if he needed me to return I would be able to do so with 24 hours notice. 

I didn't mention to any of my coworkers I had interviewed for a new job and expected an offer any day. So in the meantime I went home and requested my vacation pay because I needed some income, and waited for my offer. Luckily when they told me I had quit I had the receipts from my email that the supervisor was lying. 

A week later I got my offer and I quit immediately üòÇ. They didn't have any work for me anyway, I hadn't worked in 3 weeks at that point, my drug addicted supervisor in my home region had run off all our clients. 

I worked with that guy again several years later and I refused to even be a little helpful to him, barely civil in fact. Why would you effe with someone's employment like that for no reason?"

I typed up a one line resignation letter, walked into my bosses office and just said 'You don't appreciate my work clearly, so I won't be working here anymore' and left.

I reported her to the company's owners, it was a smaller company so no HR or anything. Owners seemed sympathetic, until about a week later, on payday, I get an e-mail saying that due to my ""inter-personal conflict"" with another employee I will not be paid any bonuses this month. For the record, my salary is almost nothing, by contract I get about 85% of my money through the company's bonus schemes.

I read that e-mail, stood up and walked out. Another co-worker asked me where I'm going. I said I'm not coming back, to tell the bosses that and that I'll be here in a few days to grab my documents and the rest of my things.

They had this bankrupt culture of repeating how great it was to work there. All the time, it was like a cult.

In less then a month it was clear I've made a big mistake, and it was all downhill from there. Lasted 12 months, and many crazy stuff happend.

Heard some openly racist crap in a call, from another worker in a different country, my manager tried to fizzle things down. 

She also tried to give the credit for things I did to someone she liked better in our team.

And the best one: she didn't want me to participate in her review meeting with her boss, so much so she changed meeting time after I left office to early next morning, before my time to arrive - and she made sure the system sent no emails to me so I had no idea it was happening. By coincidence I decided to get to work earlier that morning, and entering the office, passing by meeting rooms - all with big glass windows, her boss signaled to me, and once I entered the room she started to skold me for making her wait. I explained it had to be a mistake, our meeting was scheduled for the afternoon. It was obvious I've been framed and if was getting the shaft, could as well thrown everything in the open, and so I did. 

Because I was obviously unhappy, I was let go about 1 month after that - and I was grateful for it - but it seems things started to reorganize themselves after, last I heard my former manager was let go 4 months latter.

So I left a short review on Glassdoor, going on how difficult it was to keep work life balance there, how unprepared some managers are and overall, company's culture was lacking. Didn't write any names, just generic ""this place could improve"" review. It never saw the light of the day, only reviews for that company on Glassdoor are bright 5 stars, they won't publish anything different.

Assuming this is Australia for MOST types of employment (as far as I can tell) you are legally required to provide notice:

\- 1 week if you've worked less than a year

\- 2 weeks if you've worked between 1-3 years

\-3 weeks for 3-5 years

\-4 weeks for 5+ years.

(d) If an employee who is at least 18 years old does not give the period of notice required under clause 30.1(b),then the employer may deduct from wages due to the employee under this award an amount that is no more than one week‚Äôs wages for the employee.

\---  
Since you're in Australia you're also probably covered by common-law interpretations where your employer could come after you for any material loss that resulted from your insufficient notice (they would need to show very specifically how they lost money as a result of your quitting without notice - For example if they paid liquidated damages on a contract or were forced to turn down work they would have otherwise reasonably expected to acquire).

The fairwork provisions allows them to withhold up to a week of pay for insufficient notice without proving that loss, common law requires proof that your lack of notice caused the material loss."

These victims obey orders or-else, no matter how arbitrary. The authorities keep them under regular surveillance. State bureaucrats control even the smaller details of everyday life. The officials who push them around are answerable only to the higher-ups, public or private. Either way, dissent and disobedience are punished. Informers report regularly to the authorities.

If you do work and reduce the overall workload then you reduce the efficiency of the corporation.

The more work you complete, the less work there is for the other employees.

This implies the company has to stop growing, it needs a growth rate of work to match it's overall growth.

The easiest way to accomplish this form of growth is to discuss and plan, but not complete the work.  This is why we see huge proliferation of project/product managers, middle management and a ""people"" function; they grow the company and give the illusion of value while not reducing the organisations appetite for growth.

This is the result of depending on work provided life insurance and I see it every day. You see, Office Depot would not have had to pay an additional cent wether or not she got her payout, because that‚Äôs on the life insurance company. And that‚Äôs how work group life insurance works, you have to technically have worked at least a day under the plan to be covered. In this case she didn‚Äôt so she wasn‚Äôt. The company may have changed out their provider for numerous reasons, most likely cost related. But it‚Äôs highly unlikely that Office Depot did it purposely to screw her over. This was more likely due to the fact that to mega corporations we are just numbers. Some of these decisions are made at corporate offices by people who don‚Äôt even know you. You can argue someone could have spoken up to allow an exception, but she just had bad luck all the way to the grave and beyond.
How can you avoid this? BUY YOUR OWN LIFE INSURANCE. Many people don‚Äôt buy a policy because their work ‚Äúgives them‚Äù a free or super cheap one. And that‚Äôs ok to supplement with the enticingly good offer, but not to depend entirely on it. She could have even been laid off before the cancer hit, then got cancer and couldn‚Äôt buy a policy with a preexisting condition. You‚Äôre just setting yourself up to fail if something g as important as insurance depends on your job."

The company doesn‚Äôt pay for the death benefit, obviously the insurance company does. 

2. The new life insurance company has every right to decline someone for coverage if they have a pre existing terminal illness. It‚Äôs actually one of the very few things that is an automatic decline on guaranteed coverage without full underwriting. Don‚Äôt hold it against the new insurance company. That‚Äôs standard policy across the board. 

3. Question is what amount of insurance are they paying for‚Ä¶is it 1x salary or did she elect more coverage with full health underwriting originally? If it‚Äôs the latter, her company is screwed. 

4. Sounds like the company was changing providers which if someone is on DI or other benefits that are currently paying, employees must be offered the new benefits in open enrollment OR they can continue with the same benefits but usually they will have to cover the premium which is extremely low. See point 3. 

If the company didn‚Äôt offer this to the employee when they switched providers, this is a pretty open and close case of pure negligence. Company should be on the hook for any unpaid medical debt plus life insurance death benefit. If the company has documented that all of this was offered and employee/POA/medical decision maker decline after reasonable attempts, then it‚Äôs a different story and harder battle. 

Company is going to pay either way just depends how much. More context is needed but they should hire a lawyer asap."

* As work seeps into our lives and homes, a typical 9-to-5 workday has become a thing of the past. Not only are people clocking in more daily hours than before the coronavirus pandemic, but a survey of knowledge workers found that [over 90% of employees also frequently work in the evenings and on weekends](https://www.businessinsider.com/4-day-workweek-evidence-prevent-burnout-productivity-ai-well-being-2023-4?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=insider-antiwork-sub-comment). People have no breathing room to disconnect from work during the week, and weekends have morphed into support systems for our jobs rather than desperately needed time away. This always-on culture has left workers feeling burned out.
* Since I first began working a shorter week in 2018, the movement to shift the workweek to four days has gained considerable steam. Hundreds of companies and thousands of employees have taken part in trials across the globe. The largest ‚Äî [involving about 3,000 workers and 61 companies in the UK](https://www.businessinsider.com/4-day-workweek-evidence-prevent-burnout-productivity-ai-well-being-2023-4?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=insider-antiwork-sub-comment) ‚Äî concluded earlier this year.

* And while the UK study was the latest and largest, dozens of experiments undertaken over the past few years have borne out the idea that the four-day workweek is better for workers and companies alike. In 2019, for instance, Microsoft Japan employees worked four days a week with no reduction in pay for a summer, and yet, the company said [its workforce was 40% more productive](https://www.businessinsider.com/4-day-workweek-evidence-prevent-burnout-productivity-ai-well-being-2023-4?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=insider-antiwork-sub-comment).

I can spend part of my paycheck on insurance that has a $4000 deductible, and even then doesn't pay 100% of my medical expenses, it just paid 80% which was still pretty good actually.

OR, I could go through the marketplace and spend $600-$800 a month for a $10,000 deductible plan. (The cheapest plans offered to me, with all the stipulations as before). 


Plus your premiums (what you pay monthly) don't go towards your deductible (what you have to pay before insurance kicks in, AND you might have a copay!). Plus I get to fight with them if I need to be on certain meds, or certain tests. Gotta get that time consuming prior authorization. 


And dental? Separate, and they usually only cover up to a certain amount anyway. My last insurance only covered up to $2000 worth of work. A root canal will easily put you up there. I had insurance and it cost about $1500 out of pocket AFTER insurance, for a root canal and a cap. 


Vision? Also separate. 


It's so much fun trying to figure out what insurance will cover and how expensive it's going to be. It's not upsetting at all!"

These contractors don‚Äôt train - they expect people to pay for that on their own. Who the fuck‚Äôs going to go into debt to learn a skill they‚Äôll make $15 an hour for? 

CWA, IBEW, etc. are busy trying to hold onto their existing membership‚Äôs jobs at the carriers, who are doing everything they can to eliminate represented employees by contracting *everything* out. They prefer smaller contractors, because it‚Äôs easier to bully small outfits and create race-to-the-bottom bidding wars. It also ensures GloboTelcoMonster‚Äôs legal department *always* outguns their opposition.

Unionizing a million little LLCs would ruin unions financially so they‚Äôre not interested, the big telcos will do everything in their power to prevent contractor consolidation, and everyone loses (including telcos, when the infrastructure built by overworked, underpaid slaves fails constantly; they don‚Äôt care because they pretend those costs aren‚Äôt real by hiding them on a different spreadsheet).

The only real solution is to treat distribution networks like highways. Nationalize *all* the outside plant and have the government build it. Telco executives get to finally be free of their ‚Äònightmare‚Äô (HA) ‚Äújust dumb pipe providers‚Äù existence, everyone else gets infrastructure that wasn‚Äôt built 50, 70, or 100 years ago.

Worked 3 days that were less than 12 hours the whole time, my longest shift there was 36 hours in a row, 3 hours later i get a call saying i needed to come back in for another 12 hour day. 

I was only getting $18 an hour at the time but the foreman I had only made a couple bucks an hour more for 90% more responsibility.

I don't even have kids and I left due to the overtime because I wanted to be home more. 

There was no accountability from management. Everything got blamed on the crews out in the field when jobs were bid incorrectly. But to bid the management was supposed to scope out the job on site. What they would do instead was Google Street view everything from their house instead of driving a company truck for a couple hours. 

The turnaround was incredible. I had a decent amount of seniority after 10 month on the crews. Couldn't get anyone hired on because HR wouldn't get back to applicants for 3 months.

Companies charge for you to send a crew out, mobilization, so you have to justify sending them to sites, it cant be 2 splices and 4 hours of work, thats not economical‚Ä¶

Additionally, America‚Äôs telecom companies as well as state owned power companies like to make access to their pole‚Äôs extremely difficult to get and time consuming, and then once you have access to their poles you need to clean (tree trimming etc.) the poles up to use them. 

On top of all of that, theres the issue of easements, some towns don‚Äôt have their utilities easements written in a way that describes fiber optics as a utility, so you have homeowners complaining about the line work for a network to be put in, which delays the entire implementation of the network.

So while yes, splicers are not getting paid enough, they aren‚Äôt running line work, which eats into a project budget. They arent dealing with towns and homeowners over easement issues and right of way‚Äôs. They arent designing the network or the subdivision, nor are they handling site development, setting poles, running line or doing customer installs. Splicers handle a narrow field of critical tasks, they obviously splice cables together, they also setup splitters and connect terminals, but outside that there isnt much else they do, atleast for me that is.

3865,"Not a meme, or is it funny",5815,antiwork,12wjxhw,https://i.redd.it/zsf1cri6rnva1.jpg,477,"I think the crux of the argument here is whether or not it is ok for a business to have to temporarily stop or delay certain functions to facilitate employee's taking time off.  I think it depends on the business, if you run a hospital obviously you can't  just shut the whole hospital down for a week so that 80% of the staff can take vacation at the same time, patients could die or suffer serious injury.  In this instance employees may have to put up with less flexibility in taking PTO due to the nature of the business they work for.

&#x200B;

Alternatively if you work for a distribution warehouse that ships printer paper to offices you can totally stop or slow operations for a week if a 80% of the employees want to take vacation at the same time.  Management needs to have a plan for ""emergency operations"" to cover these scenarios, when you are trying to run a department at 20% staff you need to really prioritize which tasks need to be done right away and which tasks can wait.  If something is low priority wait for staff to get back from PTO.  Management may have to call customers and have an uncomfortable conversation about how a customers order will be delayed a couple days because it is not the priority.

&#x200B;

In my experience most managers are godawful at setting priorities on task completion and accepting when low priority task don't get done.  They usually have the mindset of ""everything needs to get done, I will make everything high priority and everything will get done quickly""  That is not how priorities work and that is piss poor management.

&#x200B;

Everyone wants to think that their business is super important and if it stopped operations for a week the world would stop spinning but honestly most companies are just not that important and need to get over themselves.  I am sorry but the local Kohls not having any red polo shirts for a week is not a world ending emergency, you'll live."

I'm assuming you live in the United States.  Do this when you get home tongiht:

\- There are people who say not to report incidents to HR because HR works to protect the company, not you.  Do not listen to these people.  HR absolutely exists to protect the company, but you need to have a record of reporting incidents to HR, or they can make the claim that they had no knowledge of the harassment occuring.

\-Do a write up of both incidents of sexual harassment, and be clear and concise, and state the exact language that he used that made you severely uncomfortable.  **PUT IT IN WRITING THAT YOU BROUGHT UP THESE INCIDENTS WITH YOUR BOSS, WHICH WERE DISMISSED WITHOUT ADDRESSING THE PROBLEM**.

\- Make a profile on the EEOC website. which will then entitle you to file a Charge of Discrimination.  This is an Example of the EEOC Charge of Discrimination:  
[https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated\_files/eeoc/foia/forms/form\_5.pdf](https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/eeoc/foia/forms/form_5.pdf)

\- Include your letter to HR and anything else relevant as additional exhibits to accompany the Charge of Discrimination claim form.

\- Take a copy of the this submitted claim form, and forward a copy to HR via Email.  This lets them know you aren't fucking around.  

\- If you are terminated after submitting this complaint, you likely have grounds to file a Wrongful Termination suit.  If this happens, very few lawyers that are competent would not take your case on a commission basis.

\- Make note of how HR, your boss, and the co-worker treat you moving forward.  Do your best to continue to be professional and compelte work in a timely and complete manner.

\- There are strict limits on the time you have from **THE DATE OF THE INCIDENT (180 Days)** to report harassment.

I've just given you a checklist that will in time put the Federal Government so far up you company's ass, they'll know if your boss is going Keto.  It will take time, but once the gears start moving, they will be inexorable.  Should you resign prior to that point, make it clear to HR that a toxic and unsafe work environment is the reason you are leaving.  Keep that letter/e-mail.

I wish you the best of luck, and invite you to DM me should you have further questions."

Besides weird bits of geometry, it's very likely that the poor code that made these glitches possible had ramifications elsewhere in the game, and it's pretty understandable for a developer to not want to leave the vulnerability just in case it affects someone's experience. Their goal is to ship a complete and functional product, and leaving gaps in that just so a niche group of people (Who can downpatch) can get faster times just doesn't make much sense

Turbonerd nitpick moment but this isn't always the case! 

In some games totally intended interactions can have unintended outcomes. The usual example I see is damage boosting to skip puzzles/picking up an item in a zelda dungeon.

It's not a glitch, but it's still doing something that wasn't intended by the developers. Knockback on damage was intended, but they never expected you to use it to cross that gap without the intended item.

After listening to the Behind The Bastards four part series about Andrew Tate I don't understand how anyone old enough to get their drivers license could possibly find anything of value in Andrew Tate's ""wisdom"" and ""career advice.""

You know how they say ""Newt Gingrich is a dumb person's idea of a smart person?"" Well Andrew Tate is an angry hormonal teenager's idea of what it means to be a man. There's no substance to him, it's just comically dumb posturing, misogyny, and crime.

Part of being on the clock and being respectful to your coworkers is also fostering an environment where you look out for them and they look out for you. I would never expect a customer to clean up because, well, they're often not accountable and getting into a fight about that would be more stress than it's worth. If they offer - I'll take it, but shit happens. 

Someone's gotta deal with it, and if we all take this attitude of ""not my job, not my problem"" then shit like this happens. People are also more willing to help if they see you act IME.

The employees should be calling the shots in day to day business and their judgment and decisions should not only be trusted but have full support by the bosses.

I haven't been around Magic for a long while (last I got into it I was a very casual Commander player), but this is one of the reasons why I don't like associating myself with the community. Magic is unfortunately one of those hobbies that have a ""financial"" barrier to entry. Sure, you can play with what you got, but if you wanted to get into competitive Standard, you have to keep buying updated sets. Similarly, if you really were interested in restricted formats, you'd have to shell out even more money to play, when the reality is we have all the info from those cards. Why can't we just play with that info instead of gatekeeping those people who are genuinely interested in the play just because they don't have a hard copy of a first edition?

Some would say, ""well, you're a casual Commander player. You're an example of how you don't even need to spend a ton of money to play that format."" Well, I did, lol. Probably not as many folks playing in Vintage/Restricted. But even for us, someone having the newest cards added to their commander deck wasn't a fun experience for everyone-- either there was always one person in the group who was power-creeping the rest of us because we didn't buy into the new sets, or that person felt like they have to be held back from building the way they want to build because everyone else didn't have access to the cards they did.

No, gentlemen, I'm sorry, but it's not. 

That pretty lady rubbing her bits and bangles on you,  flirting with you, making you feel all sorts of wanted? She's not doing it because she's aroused, or thinks you're hot,  or wants to bang you. It's her job to make you think she thinks that. 

You want the stripper. The stripper does not want you. 

She's here for business. The customer is there for pleasure.

(I see the hypocrisy, don't worry. But that's the broad strokes issue.) They're both based in sex, but the motivation behind each role is 100% different. You think that car salesman really thought all your jokes were funny, or that call center lady actually liked talking to you? No, they're there to sell you a product and the stripper sells you theirs: the illusion of being wanted, the permission to gaze freely at their body, an escape into carnal indulgence.

He was the *receiver* of the sexual attention, the one who sought it out in order to be aroused (normally. Here it was for spite.) Assumably, the girlfriend is pissed because he didn't do something that's 'business,' he did the one for 'pleasure.' With him knowing what he was getting into when he decided to date a stripper, and him doing something shitty out of spite... They're better off apart is all I'm saying.

[There's a reason why strippers don't strip in their hometown. If the person you were dancing for was your 1st grade teacher, would you see it as just performing a task to get paid?](https://www.reddit.com/r/meirl/comments/12rnqot/meirl/jgvrxvc)

Yes, and that reason is specifically because strippers realize that the job they (or any other sex worker) do is inherently sexual and they don't want to run into the town gossip or someone they or their family know personally because they don't want uncomfortable interactions (both in the moment and potentially in the future) and don't want to be judged for what they do to pay the bills.

It's *not* because they're afraid they're going to arouse (or be aroused by) their first grade teacher.

It's really not terribly complicated."

The options here are 1) he was never okay with her job but thought he could magically change her, 2) got bad advice from the internet and didn't realize it was going to blow up his relationship, 3) was already looking for an excuse to get out and paint her as the bad guy for the break up, so staged something to make her the hypocrite, or 4) complete fiction meant to stir up certain groups commonly found on reddit.

These discussions about SpaceX funding are always super-frustrating to read or participate in. There's so much nuance to it that gets lost by some catchy phrases that are half-truths/manipulative, or people simply refuse to accept some political realities around that company.

Litmus test is always to ask if one agrees that SpaceX is largely financed by the US budget and the company gets preferential treatment.

> It's just their rapid iteration process. 

The last test flight they did was in March 2021. Now we have April 2023.

Also: They already built **26** of these ""prototypes"", only 12 of which were actually used in some material tests. How many of these tests couldn't be done by a proper computer simulation? I would say: majority. Not all, obviously, but majority.

On a topic of an extremely challenging, never-before-done designs: Both Buran and Space Shuttle were developed with support of computers back during the Cold War, they were arguably much bigger breakthroughs than the Starship (first spaceplanes, first reusable rockets, largest mass to orbit lifted to date, largest crew, and countless other records and firsts, and that's at the time when we knew but a fraction of what we know today about launches and reentries) and **they both succeeded on all their test flights**.

At the same time you know which rocket went through a rapid iterative process that lead to countless explosions? The N1.

So... sorry, but the people who try to glorify this approach make me eyeroll. Sure, there's a lot of new stuff in every new launcher, Starship more so than perhaps any rocket during the last two decades, but what they do strikes me more as a spectacle, to show how much they do and how far they gone, while still having a ton of technical debt to deal with. But it works - it granted them numerous contracts, most  notable being [$2.9 billion](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/16/science/spacex-moon-nasa.html) and [$1.15 billion](https://spacenews.com/nasa-awards-spacex-1-15-billion-contract-for-second-artemis-lander-mission/) with a number of additional, more obscure money, such as [$95 mln](https://spacenews.com/air-force-adds-more-than-40-million-to-spacex-engine-contract/) injected by the Air Force to the Raptor engine development without expecting anything back, an engine that still, 6 years after the contract, has an absurdly high failure rate.

Additionally SpaceX got absurd amount of non-taxpayer money from their numerous funding rounds in tens of billions since the development of Starship has begun. Their internal finances are totally opaque, so its impossible to tell what goes where and how their finances stand, but it's certainly not helped by Starlink being a black hole of money (next year the first of the v.1.0 satellites will start running out of their lifespan, and it will only get worse from there on). Overall the future of SpaceX is a huge question mark, and I seriously doubt they will survive the next financial crisis, when they burn money left and right."

Just because you don‚Äôt like someone or something doesn‚Äôt mean they never did or achieved anything good. Tom cruise is my favourite example. On one hand does that super weird Scientology thing (almost certainly because of his childhood abuse which is an interesting read btw) that people rightly criticise. But on the other hand he‚Äôs a lovely person who cares for his craft and is a great actor that is almost entirely interested in making the most entertaining films possible. But a lot of people on here just refuse to accept that because of the negative aspect.

Fox on the other hand, spun off from itself during the Disney takeover, with 20th/21st century Fox (among other assets) moving under the Disney banner whilst Fox News remained under the Fox banner, separate from the takeover (due to legal reasons, namely the dual network law).

It's not the same circumstance (I'm referring to the poster in the original post who used that as a reference).

Buzzfeed news did some good journalism and it sucks to see them go, but that association to Buzzfeed and its more toxic, clickbait components is always gonna be there. I can see some of them moving over to the Huffington Post (staying under the same banner) too."

This is the biggest title in chess, and the two competitors have each spent months working with their teams to come up with strategies to win. Unfortunately for Ding, he and his ""second"" (another high level grandmaster named Richard Rapport) seem to have gone through a lot of their preparatory work using anonymous accounts on two of the major chess websites, where all games are publicly visible. Chess fans looking into the moves played during the championship games so far noticed that some unique sequences were played exactly by these anonymous (and low-rated) accounts, suggesting very clearly that Ding and Rapport were behind them. This is extremely bad news for Ding since it means much if not all of his prep is compromised, and he's already behind in the match, and he also missed a definite chance today to tie the score up.

This all came out during today's game, so during the post-game press conference it was obviously the hot topic to ask about, but the chess community (at least on Reddit) was not happy with *how* it was asked about by the journalist who brought it up, nor about his other questions."

Personally, I don't particularly think blockchain or NFTs are all that useful or effective at doing what they do. But that wasn't the question.

I also think there are better arguments than energy, that's kind of a 2021 criticism. It's still relevant to the rest of crypto, but since most NFTs are using Etherium, it's kinda weak criticism. There are better criticism to crypto in general that are less refutable. (like how blockchain is a terribly, terribly inefficient way to create a ledger)

No. They pick on epic because they brought platform exclusivity to PC games when that used to just be bullshit consoles had to put up with. 

The only games that have ever been exclusive to Steam are Valve games. 

Exclusivity is straight up anti consumer. It had an excuse when consoles were all radically different machines. No excuse anymore. Never was an excuse on PC.

I've seen a lot of Reddit's stages across my 13-14 years of occasional-to-heavy usage, and while there have always been problems with the site admins and their policies, this one feels like a bit of a death knell. Reddit was, at least for a while, one of the last major sites that hadn't been excessively monetized and corporatized to shit. (Against the site admin's best attempts over the years!) 

I came back to Reddit quite heavily in the last 1-2 years, only through Reddit Sync. It's the last ""social"" website that I felt was informative and let me have a personalized experience that I *actually* wanted, rather than whatever FB or IG's algorithms wanted to force down my throat. I've been able to engage with my local community, get useful and actionable immigration advice, and learn from lots of knowledgeable people. Literally just this weekend, I passed a few hours on a roadtrip reading r/badlinguistics. Where else am I gonna find that type of content? lol. I've even made some 10+ year friendships from Reddit, with decent people who have helped and supported me in difficult times. 

I suspect there are probably many in my age cohort (younger millennials and older) who feel this way, but I've been really mourning the version of the internet that wasn't completely taken over by bots and corporations. Reddit has never been perfect, and at many points it's been actively bad, so it's sad that it's become this last bastion of content freedom to me. Fuck. Times have changed."

It's a private, for-profit company that relies largely on volunteers. Mods do the work of admins on other websites, and most social media platforms pay top content creators. At the risk of sounding like an idiot, I've produced a large volume amount of high quality and popular content over the years as evidenced by karma and awards. So far, I've treated this place like a coffee shop or bar where I hang out. 

I don't mind that Reddit collects ad revenue and the profit from awards because it's still a decent place to hang out and talk. But if they start making me look at ads and otherwise make Reddit more obnoxious to use, they're not just not paying me, they're actively charging me to generate content for them. If they can balance/ get away with this, fine. But at some point, I'm just going to hop onto one of the many platforms that not just more fun to use, but that actually pay me (especially since the topics I like are the highest ad revenue topics on Youtube). Content creator and moderator are actual jobs nowadays. 

Ultimately, if the NCAA is just a non-profit setting up games for students to play then it was fine not to pay college athletes. Once it became a huge business complete with sports betting, massive ad revenue, expensive TV rights, etc., the players wanted to be paid. The same thing applies here. And if mods and top users start demanding real money, this website is dead just like Digg, Voat, and all the others."

It essentially boils down to ""once we get mod tools in parity, and once ""a vast majority of the userbase"" enjoys using new reddit, they'll shutter support for old.reddit. This is not speculation. This is straight from the horse's mouth. The userbase is actually already there, their own metrics has the old.reddit userbase as a teeny tiny portion, so I guess it just depends on how much of the engagement comes from that sector as well.

The first morning I asked for some random thing (I can't remember what) we picked up the night before and she mentioned she had put it in the fridge. I walked into the kitchen and looked around. I don't see a fridge. It's a tiny kitchen so there aren't that many places to hide. So I walk back out and ask about the location of this supposed fridge.

""It's under the counter on the left"".

And so it was. A fridge smaller than my garage beer fridge.

So, yeah, if my fridge was that small I'd keep the eggs in a drawer too."

Hell, you could even pay taxes twice or more if you belonged to a disputed part of land. Collecting taxes is a privilege of the land owner after all which helps both establish your claim - plus it's money. 

It didn't really matter what the land's workers felt was wrong unless they wanted to resist taxation, which absolutely happened.

When in fact they do want to do X.

He‚Äôs very friendly, and very well trained, but he‚Äôs always leashed and harnessed outside their property because he weighs 100 lbs, is probably almost 6 feet on his hind legs, and all the training in the world still hasn‚Äôt gotten rid of his urge to jump when he‚Äôs excited and his tail wagging has knocked over end tables before. 

Like‚Ä¶ people don‚Äôt get that friendly dogs can do damage too just by being big and excited, and even the sweetest dogs in the world can still hurt someone if they‚Äôre provoked. Even beyond that, not everyone likes dogs/wants to be sniffed and rubbed on by your dog. I like dogs, but I‚Äôm not always in the mood to cuddle one at random because they came running up to me. 

Leashing your dogs on trails is safer and more convenient for everyone *including the dog* who, aside from all mentioned above, might go running off if they smell an animal and get lost in an unfamiliar area. I just do not get taking THAT risk even if you think your dog won‚Äôt hurt anyone."

In my city, there‚Äôs an ordinance that requires pets to be microchipped. If your dog is found roaming in any way (or your cat, even) and it gets picked up, it‚Äôs an immediate $200 fine + shelter fees + a second citation if you don‚Äôt have the rabies vaccine up to date. Yeah, I managed to train a recall command in to my animal and I‚Äôm legitimately proud of him when he recognizes it. Do I have over $300 worth of trust in him to be able to let him run without a leash? Hell nah. 

That‚Äôs not even considering the dangers that are out there. Do these owners not consider the trouble a curious dog might get in to? Or as evidenced in that thread, the amount of people who would go out of their way to hurt their pet? Why take a chance on that when someone is bragging about shooting any off-leash pet they see?"

In my town its illegal to have your dog offleash anywhere that isnt a specified trail, and so many dog owners here just seem unable to follow that rule. I take pics of any off leash dogs and regularly report them to bylaw so they can send a patrol up to the area and fine anyone who‚Äôs not cooperative.

When there‚Äôs a sign that says ‚Äúoff-leash park‚Äù or if it‚Äôs a public trail, you can usually let your dog off the leash, provided it‚Äôs well-trained in recall if the park isn‚Äôt fenced in. For trails I personally only let my dog off if it‚Äôs mostly empty. That‚Äôs just my comfort level, knowing my dog loves to run.

The problem arises when people overestimate how well trained their dog is and how it will react when confronted by an unknown person or animal. A lot of people don‚Äôt expose their pet to these situations and therefore don‚Äôt know how it will react.

Also, the much less frequent but way bigger issue is dog owners who don‚Äôt leash their dogs at all. I‚Äôm talking downtown of a major city. Like, they‚Äôd rather show off their training skills than protect their pet from harm."

Is this a trick question?"

I just happen to be in my kitchen looking out my window and I see this university student (we live near the campus) jog up behind our house, do a suspicious couple of looks around, and then open our back gate.

I was already coming out to ask her to leave because I thought she was just trying to short cut through our yard like students had done in the past. So when I came out, I saw her finishing  a lap and then start to pull down her pants. I began yelling at her to leave and she said she had to dump (not just pee - which was still a no!) and didn‚Äôt think anyone was home. She didn‚Äôt say she had an emergency or anything just that she had to go and this was easier. She sounded offended with me questioning her. I said I‚Äôd call the police if she didn‚Äôt leave. She threw me a dirty look and jogged back out the gate.

She didn‚Äôt need to use my yard. We live across from a small mall that has a public bathroom, as well as a Starbucks and McDs a block the other away. She just got too lazy to go off her jogging route. Never saw her again thankfully but we put a low bolt on the gate after that."

I got permanently banned from Reddit several months ago after the mod at r/eyebleach banned me for harassment and threatening violence for a single comment: pointing out that pit bulls can be dangerous if you have kids.

 Then they escalated it to the admins when I responded by pointed out nothing I'd done was either harassment or threatening violence.

Funnily enough, I just checked my inbox after reading this thread and apparently the admins reinstated my account a few weeks back. This is my first post since then. Hope I don't get banned again merely for pointing out that [redacted] abuses their position.

Comments deleted and post locked...,3165,SubredditDrama,12ns0hq,https://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/12ns0hq/redditor_exposes_that_the_some_of_the_biggest/,743,"So I'm just going to say it. Who the hell cares? Number one, this list is wildly out of date. Somebody finds it every 6 months and reposts it and meanwhile at least one of the people on that list doesn't even have an account anymore.

Number two, there's a certain gravity to things like moderating large subreddits. The largest subreddits on this site are not going to pick a brand new moderator who has never been in charge of a subreddit of size. So you start out moderating something small, and then you move up to something larger, and then you move up to something larger, and most of the time you don't leave the ones you were already in. And eventually, yes, you are moderating extraordinarily large subreddits because you are the type of person who has experience moderating somewhat extraordinarily large subreddits and below. This should not come as a surprise to anyone. This is literally how all organizations work. You don't find yourself CEO of a Fortune 500 company fresh out of high school.

Number three, every time this gets posted, the exact same conspiracy theories run rampant about how these super moderators have somehow formed a hideous cabal of control over this meme and porn wonderland despite absolutely no evidence that any of these people are actually doing anything wrong. It's entirely possible some of them are total douchebags but odds are good if you're complaining about how hard they are censoring you, you are probably saying things that ought to get taken down anyways. Frankly, I would love for somebody to find and share a W-2 that one of these so-called gods of Reddit are earning from wasting a ton of their free time on this website. People seem to believe they are somehow earning money from this, but just like the whole people with huge karma accounts can sell them thing, I don't ever see anybody actually posting any actual evidence.

Everybody wants to see a conspiracy theory when the reality is these are just nerds like us that just have a little bit more spare time to spend blocking bigots and shitposters.

Edit: bring on the downvotes, folks. People are so desperate to believe that there's some grand conspiracy here and the reality of it is probably just boring as hell. The only way you can feel better about this situation that does not at all impact you is to downvote people speaking the truth, then go for it."

Big subreddits generally take A LOT of time to moderate. Most users do not have that kind of time or energy to commit to Reddit. 

Anytime I‚Äôve seen calls for new mods on a sub, they almost always, especially on the big ones, expect you to have mod experience. So it can be hard to break into, and much easier for someone who already mods one sub to mod another one as well."

I'm interested how the comment ratings might have changed since this was posted here, because they're at least in line with sanity right now, which is reassuring.

Obviously it's unreal that there are people defending, downplaying, or even somewhat both-sidesing the attempted murder of an 11 year old child (who's white), but at least they're not being well received.

It takes a hell of a lot to push people (not ""Reddit"", not ""the internet"", *people*) out of their child hating comfort zone, but apparently this is it, so that's something."

Because I'm an English teacher in primary school and English has very clear rules that I teach my students.

But then I always come across linguist hobbiests that will proclaim ""it's not incorrect English, it's a dialect"". Or ""if people use it that way then it's correct"".

So why even teach English as a subject then?

Some of my students say ""Me is 6 me like cat"". Should I just say they're correct because ""people use it that way"", or declare a new dialect?

I've also learned Chinese, where I was told there are very clear rules. I've passed government tests in Chinese proficiency, where there are very clear rules.

So I'm confused as why it's only English where these ""linguist hobbiests"" say there's no rules.

I really don't mind it, and I get a fair amount do mind it now so I certainly feel left behind by online discourse on the matter since I don't really interact much beyond my small bubble of trusted friends. I will note though that I am significantly bothered by the word ""autistic"" itself being used as an insult whereas retard is just within the ""dipshit/idiot/moron/etc"" category of words used around me.

Also now feel timid all the time if by my personal lack of offense at the word retard, and allowing it to be used around me in my friend group (and tbh, I use it the most even to describe myself at times) that it makes things worse somehow."

if it was really about the domestic violence, he should be on trial for domestic violence, not spitting at a cop. if its about proven past crimes, and he's done the time for them, why is he being punished a second time for them? 

I'm not gonna shed a tear for an abuser, but if the guy with all the info is correct, the rules about proof and evidence and so on are relaxed at that stage of the trial so he's gotten put away based on proving he did one thing but put away for so long based on something that doesn't need much in the way of proof. that seems like a shitty system and the fact that it put away a domestic abuser this time doesn't stop the next guy getting put away for something unproven the jury doesn't like, like idk spit at a cop but you have a history of unproven altercations with cops at climate protests and the jury or judge are all that sort"

I was recovering from a pretty severe injury and just getting to the door was difficult, much less my normal cooking.  When the person got here they asked if I could meet them outside.  I told them I wasn't sure I could make it down there safely due to an injury.  Then she responded back with a big diatribe about how someone had tried to grab her some time when she went into an apartment complex.  I apologized to her and asked if she could just refund the order since I didn't want to make her uncomfortable, but also didn't feel comfortable that I could get to the door (the elevator was the opposite side of the building from both my apartment complex and the front door)...then she sent another diatribe calling me privileged and accusing me of being a potential rapist.  I got a free re-delivery that day.

Since then I have a strict 15/50 rule for deliveries (with other services.)  I set the tip at 50% of the order and if you don't get it to the door that gets reduced to 15%.  Part of what I'm paying you for is not having to go outside.  I don't order out that much, but it's still surprising how many people will get enraged if I outright state that when they claim they can't find my apartment after sending the same directions in the delivery notes."

1. The food should be delivered to the door, or to where ever the customer asks.  

2. They've done over 100 door dashes and have never had a problem with a customer.

3. If you don't accept crappy tips from time to time they will stop giving you priority and crappy is all you'll get till your accept % goes back up.

4. Umbrellas exist, no one should be having too much trouble delivering in the rain.



Things that suck about door dash:

1. All the restaurants close in our town at like 10.. on a friday. Thank god for the 2 or 3 that stay open.

2. Having to wait in the drivethrough with 10 other non-dashers to pick up an order.  I know everyone is short-staffed, but things will go quicker if you do those in a different window or door.  Less drive thru waits, and less cars in the drive-thru.

3. Gated communities where the customer doesn't give the gate code. Door dash doesn't let us call or text the customer if there's a problem, and if no one's around at the gate, there's just no way in.  Edit: Door dash does let people call and text, but for some reason it doesn't work for us.

4. If the restaurant is out of something, they don't call the customer, and door dash doesn't let you call them either.  Ice Cream machine broke?  No way to call the customer, sorry.  Edit: It seems to be a personal issue on the ""no calling part"", but still if you can't get a hold of the customer its between them and the restaurant."

If it's a situation say in an urban area with limited to no parking, security door, and having to go up multiple flights of staris, IMO, meet the dasher instead of expecting the dasher to jump through all those hoops.

I think the few times I directly disregarded a customer's delivery instructions were cases where like, they didn't give me a door code *and* didn't answer texts/calls for several minutes, so I left it in the lobby, or one or two cases where bringing it to the door seemed literally dangerous (like I'd have to climb over snowbanks or slide up an unsalted, icy walkway or something).

It's definitely possible to be an asshole protestor, and definitely possible to abuse the ""protests should be disruptive"" idea by aiming the majority of the disruption at people who just happen to live or work nearby. 

That said, this is a Medieval Times parking lot. That is *minimal* disruption and pretty easy to avoid. Complaining about a blocked parking lot at a restaurant is soft af. That is disruptive for *the business*, and an excellent tactic. 

That is to say - it's one thing to accept some degree of disruption or inconvenience for a cause, even one you disagree with. Everyone should be willing to do that. Protest blockade - take a detour. Staff on strike - go elsewhere. It's another to be actively targeted for a cause you have zero power to fix."

I will never get down with that. Some people will agree with you, **and now you made an enemy out of _me_.**

Edited for truth. 

I'm no fan of roadway blockades, either. I think that it's a desperate first choice for maximum attention and disruption without any consideration of effectiveness or impact on the issue under discussion. My view is that serious actions like blockading a roadway - especially a major roadway like an Interstate - does more bad than good (progress towards fixing the issue under protest.)

An effective example would be a roadway blockade when three issue in question is demonstrated through said blockade because failure to fix the problem will produce the same or similar outcome. I'm having a tough time at the moment providing a good example - but the idea being that ""if you don't address and fix [X]  then this will be the result.""

I think a more clever tactic for a picket line striking a business is to not only block access to the business (like Unions have done with employers) but also possibly striking in such a way that impacts other businesses. 

Blocking random roadways for visibility (attention) is skipping straight to a nuclear option for a topic that most aren't aware of and have no opinion of. Their influence is negligible on the topic. 

**Despite that, respect the fucking demonstrations.** I don't give a shit; no excuse justifies bullying protestors with vehicular manslaughter or other crimes. These assholes that deliberately use their vehicles to engage, harass, bully, and disrupt demonstrations are douchebags hungry for an ego trip and a confrontation; nothing more.

When I get caught up in said demonstrations - such as blocking an interstate or major thoroughfare, I definitely get furious. Yes, it prejudices me against the issue. But I suffer through it and/or find a safe, non-confrontational way to bypass it if possible. I may not agree with their tactics, but I may support their agenda. And no, they aren't going to ""make an enemy"" of me. They'll annoy me and I'll criticize their poor strategies and decisions - but if their issue has merit, it continues to have merit and warrants change no matter how fucking dumb or impatient the demonstrators are."

>Upon learning that the shelter would be unable to release his feline friend until the **next morning**, the former soldier decided to escalate matters by invading the premises and brandishing his assault weapon at the worker.

When she returned to pick up her cat, the Rover sitter insisted that her cat was hiding and refusing to come out. She refused to let OP in the house to try and coax the cat out. And she told OP she had work in the morning and was going to sleep so OP needed to leave. 

The next couple of days involved the same thing over and over again. Every time OP went to pick up her cat the Rover sitter made excuses for why the cat couldn't be returned and would refuse to let OP in the house. OP tried to involve the police but they also couldn't convince the sitter to let OP try and get her cat and they didn't feel there was evidence of a crime to where they could force any outcome. 

OP tried getting Rover to settle it. Rover asked the sitter why they wouldn't let OP in the home but ultimately couldn't force the issue either. 

A lot of people had been following the story in real time and were sick with worry. On the one hand, this is evidently a known scam where Rover sitters attempt to get more overnight fees by claiming the pet can't be returned on time. But on the other hand there was significant worry that the cat had been lost and the sitter was trying to buy time or even that something had happened to the cat or the sitter was trying to sell the cat off. 

All in all, there were a lot of people who were basically saying that at a certain point they would have just busted out a window and went in to get their cat while the sitter was away from the home (at work) to make sure their cat was actually there and okay. 

In truth, I can't say I totally disagree. At a certain point, if I couldn't get any proof that my pet is safe and well and someone keeps making really weird excuses about why I can't take them home on time I might feel tempted to just go in and see for myself. 

The difference here, is this guy was only told to wait until the next morning to get his cat. And, he broke in and held employees hostage which is insane. That sounds more like a psycho using any excuse for violence than it does like a pet owner just trying to save their animal."

i think odds are the mods were power tripping but i also don‚Äôt think saddestofboys reacted super well. i‚Äôm still on his side though. i don‚Äôt necessarily blame him for reacting how he did.

edit: you know what yeah i kinda do. he‚Äôs going full blast out of basically nowhere, and i get why it looked bad on the mods‚Äô part but literally anytime somebody is anything less than 150% saddestofboys‚Äô side he just accuses them of being a sock puppet. i‚Äôm kind of baffled that so many people are just blindly taking his side and agreeing that the mods have all conspired??? 

i think the mods are being really stupid considering questions about slime molds are a huge portion of the mycology subs because it‚Äôs really hard for laymen to tell them apart from fungi. i think it‚Äôs gonna bite them in the ass and make more work for them to crack down on it. that does not mean it was a fucking *conspiracy* against this user. and for him to be like ‚Äúfuck you guys i‚Äôm taking my ball and going home‚Äù even when his adoring fans are begging him to stay, some of whom pay him on patreon??? i mean, am i the one being too hard on him? if i am, let me know. sometimes i can be like that. 

i just think that though i totally understand why it feels like shit given all his hard work, saddestofboys is handling this horribly and maybe i‚Äôm wrong but i‚Äôm sorry, i think ‚Äúgaslighting‚Äù is an absolutely wild accusation."

There are far better social media alternatives for learning about fungi like Mushroom Identification, a public group on Facebook. It‚Äôs moderated by actual mycology experts like Christian Schwartz and Alan Rockefeller. David Arora, another famous expert, posts regularly on Forage Mendocino, another public Facebook group. The mushroom identification forum on Shroomery.org is another good social media resource- also moderated by actual experts including Alan. 

Outside of social media are applications like iNaturalist and sites like mushroomobserver.org. Again, these resources are made great in part by the participation of actual experts. 

IME, r/mycology is rife with misidentification and misinformation. I haven‚Äôt seen any expert participation there. 

Mushrooms are endlessly fascinating, and you certainly don‚Äôt need to be an expert to enjoy them or engage with them safely. That said, it‚Äôs a complex subject and it‚Äôs easy to be led awry by bad information. Unfortunately, r/mycology is awash in bad information. 

I do enjoy going there from time to time to encourage people to kick big puffball mushrooms into oblivion- few things in life are more satisfying. Sadly, this practice often ends in me being unjustly accused of mushroom cruelty. Nonetheless, I keep up the good fight."

What is mycology?,1165,SubredditDrama,12jt38o,https://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/12jt38o/drama_in_rslimemolds_and_rmycology_as_a_user_is/,391,"Hello r/SubredditDrama.  I never expected to find myself here.  But as lovers of drama, I expect you like to hear both sides of every story, and seeing my username is all over this, I figured I‚Äôd post a comment.     
     
Background:   saddestofboys was a member of the mod team at r/mycology about a year ago, but left the mod team of his volition after a month or two.  He never said why; he just left.
     
Although Slime Molds are off-topic, we allow posts about them because people mistake them for fungi, and are curious about what they are.  We also get posts about plants, insects, etc. that are mistaken for fungi.  saddestofboys would often make informative comments when slime molds were posted.  Which was great.
    
In the past few months, saddestofboys has grown a bit of a fanbase, and it was becoming a problem that multiple people were tagging him in posts.  You‚Äôd have 30 comments, but 15 of them would be just people tagging him.  It was getting to the level where it was like spam.  Threads were getting overrun with people rushing to tag him, without even reading the comments to see that the majority of the comments were already tags, and that saddestofboys had already responded.  As a mod team, we decided that removing the extraneous tags was becoming necessary, because it was beginning to dominate posts, many which weren‚Äôt even slime molds.  NOTE that we weren‚Äôt removing saddestofboys informative responses, just the multiple tags, which his fans called ‚Äúslime signals‚Äù.
    
Now onto the drama!  Here‚Äôs a basic timeline of what went down:    
    
-Monday saddestofboys sent me a personal chat asking why he wasn‚Äôt allowed to post/comment.  I explained that he was indeed allowed to post/comment and that we were just removing the tags.  He was pretty hostile and the out-of-context snippets he‚Äôs been posting were from the private chat we had.   For example, I said ‚ÄúDo we want to cut down on multiple slime signals, absolutely‚Äù (context: the ‚Äúslime signal‚Äù was what his fans were calling the user tags).  He conveniently left out my next sentence which was, ‚ÄúDo we want to stop you from commenting.  Not at all, the opposite‚Äù.     
    
-Tuesday sometime after lunch, he made about 7 or 8 posts across several subreddits accusing me and a  few other mods (including a mod of r/Slimemolds as well) of trying to stifle his ability to post/comment in the subreddit.  NOTE that he hadn‚Äôt had any comments removed or been banned.   
    
-Then throughout the day saddestofboys continued to posts more stuff, mostly on his user page, accusing us.  The subreddit had a huge influx of people upset that were silencing him (which we weren‚Äôt).  And he continued to post stuff, including inflammatory type posts/comments in r/mycology about the drama, which were of course removed.    He also left a couple of his informative comments , which specifically weren‚Äôt removed.  Not banned at this point.
    
-Eventually, after about 6 hours of him continuing to post on his user page and r/mycology, creating drama, and riling up his fanbase who where spamming the subreddit with comments, intentionally off-topic posts of slime molds,and mod messages, we banned him.  We waited a long time, because we figured that‚Äôs what he wanted, so he could justify that we were silencing him.    
     
-To be clear, most of the drama happened, AND THEN we banned him.   Of course the drama has continued and today moderating the subreddit has been busy.  Honestly, we‚Äôre all looking forward to getting past this and getting back to discussion and posts about fungi, which is what the subreddit is about.     
      
I hope that fills all your drama needs!  One thing I should add is that there‚Äôs been a fair bit of harassment, including nasty messages, downvoting brigades (check out my profile, where most of my innocuous comments helping people ID their mushrooms are getting downvoted), and a mod from r/Slimemolds getting half doxxed.    Is saddestofboys responsible?  [Have a look at this post which basically says ‚ÄúPlease don‚Äôt harass or doxx, but unrelated here‚Äôs a convenient list of the users you definitely really shouldn‚Äôt be harassing/doxxing‚Äù](https://www.reddit.com/user/saddestofboys/comments/12jkcui/a_reminder_all_of_these_users_are_bullies_or_alts/).  I mean, you can make up your own mind on that."

Ea-Nasir is one of the earliest trolls we know about.

- Sold shitty quality copper to every customer. In an era where copper was the lifeline of civilization.

.

- Whenever they came back asking for refund, told them to sod off.

.

- When they sent messengers to complain, rudely rebuked them. One letter describes him literally saying something like ""This is all you're gonna get,  either take it or fuck off"".

.

- Every time he received a complaint letter, he framed them as a 'prize'. He even built a special room in his house dedicated to storing all the complaint letters, rejoicing at the large number of people he 'triggered'.

.

- At some point, his house burned down (maybe by an extremely angry customer, who knows lol), baking and permanently preserving the clay tablets in that room. There were tens if not hundreds of such letters discovered.

.

And that man lived nearly 4,000 years ago. Regardless of how good/bad of a person he was in reality, those tablets indicate that some things never change.

Another great example is Pompeii graffiti by Roman folks. They are mostly indistinguishable from modern shitposts, despite being 2,000 years old. There is something about urban lifestyle that never really changes."

From the context given about her, the woman doesn't have the social wherewithal to engage with the date to ask if she can turn the music down. I've done this before so confirmed autistic behaviour. Communicating, asking people things, manners, these are all NORMIE moves, could never be me or apparently this woman. QUEEN üëä

The bloke loses it from having his music touched üò§üò§ I've also done this, so confirmation of autism on his side as well. (Bonus: this one gets the autistic meltdown award from me, the U-turn followed by the silent treatment is extra spicy. Don't let that other autist disrupt your Zen space king fr fr)

I'm both condemning and defending both party's at once so anyone doing either of these things, that's an autism move. (But not as high tier autism as me, rookies)

I'm calling everyone autistic, ironically the only NORMIE thing to be stated in any discussion this tweet has sparked (jk, peak autism on display)

So there we have it, I officially diagnose both party's and anyone that has an opinion on this waffle with Autism. You can take that to the bank, probably better taking it to your doctor though. It'll hold, promise! ü§ûü§û"

No, that is not the primary or most common issue black people have with white people saying that word in songs we've written.

It's because of the unpleasant pang that accompanies white people using that word.

That's it. It's not something you're in the position to understand first hand, nor evidently open to understanding through faith/respect of other people.

It is an act of respect and decency to black people for white people to simply not say the n-word in either form. If a fan of this woman takes the position of ""I'd rather continue using the n-word at your concerts despite knowing how uncomfortable it makes you, so I'm not going to stop and the only way to prevent this is for you to build your art around my stubborn lack of empathy and consideration towards you"" then my position is that they're shitty fans and shitty people.

If we're not of the same racial background, you will never understand the sting of that particular racial slur, but you don't need to - all you need is enough respect for black people to support not using it."

I have a friend, who I'll refer to in the first person to protect their identity, because that's what friends do.

I worked for a huge British supermarket chain in one of their local convenience stores, taking a job there in desperation in between my seasonal outdoor work. Managing all my own finances, living alone and renting privately for the first time, I found myself really struggling and relying on hand-outs from relatives, so eventually I began relying on hand-ins instead - hand-in-the-till, I mean.

I could justify it easily at first, with it happening by accident (unintentionally cancelling a transaction, leaving no deficit and a surplus of cash), them paying us so little, and so on. Once I became skilled at the sleight of hand and means of covering my tracks though, I got greedy and didn't want to go back to struggling. I should've been looking for a new job every day, but now I had unlimited money, at the risk of getting sacked and facing immense shame.

Even though I didn't care at all for the company itself, the moral guilt of thieving was horrible, and I never expected that. I've always been a relativist with these things, and wouldn't care to judge others in that situation, but I still knew it was wrong to steal, especially out of greed, and spiritually I just felt dirty.

I came into work one day and found out I'd been caught, setting into motion a cascade of events that left me narrowly avoiding eviction two years running; much of this was unrelated, as I landed a new job quickly, but I felt like I was paying for it and had to repent one way or another.

So while I'm fine with people stealing these companies blind in theory, it's bad for the soul. You're also screwing over whomever's job it is to prevent your theft, so there's that.

And yeah, we're really good friends."

Rough estimates on insurance and taxes in California, alongside a 6% interest and 20% down payment, means a $20K / month mortgage would allow a purchase price of a house around $3.25 million.

Right now the average SF metro area home price is around $1.1 million (1), and median could be around $1.36 million (2). A budget of a $20K / month mortgage means someone could easily afford the average home in pretty much any part of the Bay Area except for homes around the Palo Alto and Mountain View Area, which can exceed that pretty quickly (1).

*Generally* speaking, no more than 28% of your gross (i.e., pre-tax) income should go to your mortgage, so in this case, we would want our tech worker to be pulling in a minimum annual salary of $857,142 (or $71,428 / month) to make that mortgage payment comfortably. We are assuming no other major outstanding debts, of course, in this example.

In terms of salary, for San Francisco it's around $175,000 for tech workers (3), although median total compensation packages (e.g., stocks) can be up to around $300,000 (4). As a comparison in the US, the per capita income is just over $37K and the median house income is just under $70K (5). 

In short, a $20K / month mortgage will get you access to a majority of homes around the Bay Area, save for some really rich portions near Palo Alto. However, even two people working for a big tech company (e.g., Google) making their median compensation package could not afford to comfortably pay a mortgage, and the monthly income required would be equivalent to the median household *annual* income, or about double per capita income in the US.

I got lucky by surviving and then worked maniacally to put myself though college (no loan debt so that helped me out too), then started making too much money to just let it sit in accounts. It‚Äôs pretty straightforward and I‚Äôm not special or better than anyone else, aside from my stature I‚Äôm pretty average.

So when he was 17, his parents had already been death for multiple decades. Likely before he was even born. Not even Jesus was able to be born without the help of at least one living parent. This man truly is a miracle gift. 

Any, from the streets all the way to his 25th year (which is when he bought a 500k house). He also went through college, so that's another 3-4 years of studying and thus not a full time job. That gives us about 5-6 years of full time work, to get half a million dollars in savings to buy his house. 

Either buddy used to be a criminal, or he's on the pc past his bedtime."

I have been driving since I was 15. I obey traffic laws, including putting on your blinker. I do it because it's the law. I've been told it helps other drivers know your intentions and it is ALWAYS better to be predictable on the roadways than anything else. I do follow the rules and do not advocate not to follow the rules.

NOW with all that being said, I can't think of one time in my driving life where what the other car was doing wasn't obvious when it came to turning or switching lanes. Whether they used their turn signal or not. I've seen people swerve from the outside of a 3 lane road into my lane, but I could tell they were doing it. 

I want to record my interactions when I drive because using my signal has caused me nothing but problems (I'm sure it has probably saved me too). If I am in a lane where there is plenty of room to get over, I have turned on my signal and had the car that i was going to get in front of me speed up so I couldn't. I've had cars pull out in front of me because my turn signal is on and I haven't gotten to my turn yet, that is 50 feet behind where the car just came out of.

The guy knew the person was coming over, a turn signal would not have stopped what he did. It would just have removed his ability to bitch about it."

I have done a variety of therapies which helped me cope but they could not fix the root problem. What helped turn my life around was rTMS (brain shocks) around year 6. If that had not helped, my next plans were trying experimental ketamine treatment, psychedelic treatment, then old fashioned ECT. I promised myself that if I had tried every treatment for that I could get my hands for 10 years without relief, I wouldn't force myself to go past a decade.

It‚Äôs a rough one and based on the individual. 

Suicidal ideation is an illness (but what if the person is terminal with another illness). It MAY be treated. Which MAY be successful. Or it can be forever present. Even with treatment. 

This is something up to the individual and their treatment team. Maybe with some input from their support network. 

I‚Äôve had depression and suicidal ideation. Got close. But managed to get through it.

I‚Äôve known too many people take their lives (know a number of veterans and people who refuse treatment). It‚Äôs horrible for those left behind. 

Held hubby as he wept for his friends. 

I know some adults where ideation and depression remains - even with medication. They are in and out of hospital. Life for them is miserable.

I don‚Äôt have an answer. Nobody does. 

My instinct is to try and preserve their lives. So that is the immediate bias."

The ocean animals are playing a different game from land animals though. The ocean has a huge variety of species forming their own complex food chains Calle plankton which includes, but is not limited to, krill. Plankton is to the ocean as plants are to the land. Due to buoyancy they can save a lot of energy per additional pound, allowing for larger sizes. Thus the largest animals to ever live are going to be carnivores.

That being said, it‚Äôs being caused by lack of a better option. I do mean that too‚Ä¶ in terms of widely available efficient calories in order to support larger animals plants are the superior option. This is cause it takes more energy to grow a plant, then grow and animals that eat said plant, lastly growing a huge animal that eats that animal‚Ä¶ than it does energy to grow a plant, then a huge animal that eats said plant. As in there is more energy loss with each step in a food chain‚Ä¶ which results in a lower maximum potential size by the end of it. So if the ocean had blooms of plant life to the extent of krill, as in only plant life, that didn‚Äôt need heavily competed for against other species‚Ä¶ then the ocean would likely be able to support something EVEN LARGER than a blue whale."

2. Always keep your door locked and if the police come do not unlock the door. Talk through it. If they say they can't hear you ignore them. 
3. If they have a warrant confirm the date, address, and name. If any one of these items is wrong the warrant is invalid. 

Why you don't open the door to police is because once you do they can put their foot in the door gap. Then if you try to close the door on their foot they now have you assaulting a police officer. Further more you are not obligated to answer any questions they have without legal representation present. So you can always say ""I cannot speak to you without my legal representation present.""

Why keep repeating the words ""black man"" when that has nothing to do with it?

If you like the food and want to stay even though you don't Iike the music, don't play yours loud enough for others to hear. Deal with it and be on your way.

The landlord wanted first, second, and last months rent plus a security deposit. We were able to look at the house while other people were living there. He had us meet him in a local pizza shop to sign paperwork and get the keys instead of at the property. We were young and stupid and didn‚Äôt realize how over a barrel he had us after signing the agreement. 

My mom saved the day. She knew the tricks of slumlords and had us go through and take pictures of every single thing wrong with the place, (some highlights include the floor under the 2nd fl bathtub being so rotted out it collapsed into the kitchen cupboards, a deflated and long dead mouse that was painted over, the master bedroom carpet being so soaked with urine that the smell was overpowering on the 101 degree moving in day, and a mummified cat  corpse in a built in toolbox in the basement ‚Ä¶ among so many other problems). She then told me to print two copies of the pics, save one set for myself in a manila envelope and put the other set in a separate folder, get it notarized with the date, and as an extra measure, send it back to our new address certified mail, (another layer for the date the package was put together). She said that if we had any problems later this would hold up in court. 

Fast forward a year. The landlord never fixed any issues, then when it was moving time he refused to return our security deposit and wanted to charge us for ‚Äúdamages‚Äù. I asked him to please come by the house and show us what damages he saw that were caused by us. Much to my surprise, he agreed and popped in. He went through and pointed out a ton of issues. I waited patiently as he went through the whole house, then showed him the pictures we took. He scoffed and said ‚Äúthese pictures could have been taken last week. These don‚Äôt prove anything.‚Äù 

I replied, ‚Äúyou‚Äôre absolutely right. These pictures don‚Äôt, but the copy of this set, which are sealed, have been notarized and was sent certified mail back to this address two days after we moved in do prove it.‚Äù 

He was sitting in his car at this point, paused momentarily, put his head down, then went into his wallet and threw enough money for our secure deposit out the window and drove off. 

We then sent the pictures to the local fair housing commission. I drove by a few months after and saw a condemned notification on the door. Felt good."

If it's a dispute over money, you clearly owe the other person the money, and it's a slam dunk case, it's the smart play to go on Judge Judy.

For anyone still, in 2023, under the impression that Judge Judy is anything but entertainment television:

Inside details and inner workings

The producers of Judge Judy hired extras from an audience service who composed the entire studio. Paid audience members were easier to control due to contracts and employment. Producers also looked for a certain demographic of individuals and sat them strategically throughout their audience. Most of these paid extras were aspiring actors.[18][50] Though tickets were not offered for the show, arrangements could sometimes be made with Sheindlin's production staff to allow fans of the show into the audience. The extras could not dress casually, and no logos or brand names could be visible on their clothing. Extras were also instructed to appear as if they were having discussions with each other before and after each case, so Byrd made such announcements as ""Order! All rise.""[51]

To acquire cases, the show generally used one of the following three options:

    Its 60 to 65 researchers, spread out across the country, entered small claims courts and photocopied numerous cases. These photocopied cases were then sent to Judge Judy producers, who reviewed them all in search of lawsuits they believed made for good television. According to the show's producers, only 3% of the photocopied cases were worthy enough for television.[18]
    Its telephone number posting/announcement presented on each episode where interested individuals could call in with lawsuits.
    Its website whereby lawsuits could be written out and submitted to the show.[52]

After one of these three processes, if the producers were interested, their employees would then call both parties and ask them questions relating to their lawsuit, making sure they were suitable for Judge Judy. If the parties agreed to be on the show and signed an arbitration contract, agreeing that arbitration in Sheindlin's court was final and couldn't be pursued elsewhere (unless Sheindlin dismissed the lawsuit without prejudice), their case would air on Judge Judy.[53]

The award limit on Judge Judy, as on most ""syndi-court"" shows (and most small claims courts in the U.S.), was $5,000. **The award for each judgment was paid by the producers of the show from a fund reserved for the purpose.**[54] Sheindlin ruled by either A.) issuing a verdict of a specific dollar amount (not always in the full amount of what is requested and rarely if ever more than what was requested even if she believed complainants were deserving of more) or B.) by dismissing the lawsuit altogether. When ruled on in these manners, cases couldn't be refiled or retried elsewhere. However, if Sheindlin specifically dismissed the lawsuit ""without prejudice"", that lawsuit could be refiled and retried in another forum. In some instances, Sheindlin dismissed cases without prejudice deliberately so that complainants pursued defendants in an actual court of law so that the defendants themselves were held financially accountable as opposed to the show. In such cases, Sheindlin had expressed particular aversion to the defendants in question.[55] Further, Sheindlin dismissed cases without prejudice when she suspected both the plaintiff(s) and defendant(s) of conspiring together to gain monetary rewards from the program.[55]

Both the plaintiff(s) and the defendant(s) also received an appearance fee. The appearance fee amount had varied between different litigants of the show: certain litigants had reported receiving a $500 appearance fee while others had reported receiving $100, and others $250.[56][57] In addition to the appearance fee amount, reportedly (at least some) litigants were paid $35 a day by the show.[57] The litigants' stay lasted for the number of days that the show did taping for that week, which was two or three days.[58] In addition, the airfare (or other means of travel) and hotel expenses of the litigants and their witnesses were covered by the show, and the experience was generally treated as an all-expense-paid vacation outside of the actual court case.[57] If there was an exchange of property, Sheindlin signed an order, and a sheriff or marshal oversaw the exchange.[59] Sheindlin saw only a half-page complaint and a defense response before the taping of the cases, sometimes only moments before.[16] Most of the cases, not including any footage deleted to meet the time constraints of the show, usually lasted anywhere from twelve to forty-five minutes.[60][61]

Judge Judy, like most court programs, was inexpensive to produce and thus created considerable income. A budget for a week's worth of Judge Judy episodes was half the cost of a single network sitcom episode.[62]"

It's felony assault/murder category of crimes. The idea is that you can be charged with assault/murder if someone was assaulted/killed as a result of your felony crime.

For instance, if you're a getaway driver for a bank robbery and the bank robber shoots someone, you can be charged with murder since someone was killed in conjunction with the felony you committed. If someone hadn't offered to be getaway driver, the robbery wouldn't have happened.

In this case, his friend ended up getting shot by police in their attempt to apprehend/stop the suspect. The idea is that, if the suspect had not committed the crime, his friend would not have been shot.

It's closely related to the RICO concept and prevents people who participate in planning/execution of violent crimes from getting away with a slap on the wrist simply because they didn't pull the trigger.

It's a controversial category of criminal law but that's what it is."

From skimming through it, it seems like the D.A. was trying to over charge him in order to force a plea deal. The court essentially threw out the charge, and then they downgraded to a lesser felony offense. After going to court, he was found not guilty of the felony offense, and guilty to two misdemeanors. He had to attend a counseling program as a result. However, because his bail was set so high when he was arrested, he had to spend the entire time waiting in jail while all this legal back-and-forth stuff was happening, which amounted to over a year.  


The two bystanders that got shot sued the city, and I'm not sure what if anything happened to the cops from the incident."

He was homeless and the police felt he needed to be arrested for a ‚Äúscene‚Äù in time square.  They open fire and hit bystanders.  Cops try to charge him for injuring the bystanders and he ends up in jail and mental institutions for the next 2 years while awaiting trial.  The prosecutor offers him a deal to take time served if he pleads guilty.  Our system is horrible

Being 'unarmed' and not being dangerous are very different things.

This kind of charge is totally permissible if a death or injury occurs while in the commission of a felony. And you can absolutely commit a felony while unarmed. It‚Äôs entirely possible this person was committing assault and a cop‚Äôs stray bullet hit someone else. In that event, the person committing the felony is culpable for the death or injury of the bystander. This is not new, and has happened to people of all races for years.

Of course they‚Äôre going to charge him, because guns would never have had to be drawn if *HE* didn‚Äôt resist arrest. He did not fire, yet he caused the situation to occur. 

I keep saying this but you idiots don‚Äôt listen, FOLLOW WHAT THE COPS SAY. If you follow their instructions, nothing will happen to you. Even if you think the arrest is ‚Äúwrong‚Äù screaming yelling and running away won‚Äôt help that case. It‚Äôs a great way to get shot. Go to jail, bail out, fight it in court.

6997,Murica,15623,facepalm,12xdsf5,https://i.redd.it/xqdp4tdfrtva1.jpg,658,"As a former resident of a neighborhood that is next to Ferguson, Mo this does not surprise me in the least! that police force actively harassed the people of Furguson, specifically the black community. I watched it happen every single day on my way to and from work. And the fact that they are charging HIm with assault for shooting him while he was unarmed to cover up their own incompetence, is par for the course for the police of that area. That whole region is full of police forces that escalate situations and are so blatantly corrupt that it's unbelievable. I'm glad I no longer live anywhere near there."
6998,Murica,15623,facepalm,12xdsf5,https://i.redd.it/xqdp4tdfrtva1.jpg,658,"This is not surprising not intrinsically a bad thing.  If you are in the commission of a serious crime and somebody dies because of that you are guilty of felony murder, regardless of whether or not you actually killed that person.  For example if you rob a bank and take hostages, if the police accidentally kill someone while raiding the bank then you are guilty of felony murder.  This applies to assault as well.  Now obviously with this case it matters what the specifics are.  What was he doing?  Was this a case of police overuse of force?  Or was he a threat?  Just because someone is ‚Äúunarmed‚Äù does not mean they are not a threat.  So if anyone has more context that would be great."
6999,Murica,15623,facepalm,12xdsf5,https://i.redd.it/xqdp4tdfrtva1.jpg,658,So let me get this straight a cop who discharges his firearm against an unarmed man (already a problem) discharged in the direction of a crowd (basic gun safety says that's a no no and a misdemeaner) and then shot a bystander (I belive that's referred to as accidentally manslaughter) and is charging what would be referred to as the victim in nearly every possible situation. Otherwise imma need waaaay more context here as to what's going on but based on current issues with police I'm guessing they're in the wrong here and committed several misdemeanors and felonies

Protests were peaceful during the day and erupted into rioting as soon as the sun started to go down. 52nd street is a main arterial that runs north to south and is where most of it took place in our part of town (downtown and north Philly also saw the same thing). There is ONE McDonalds on that street, one corporate entity (probably still owned by a black franchisee; don‚Äôt 100% know that though) the rest of the businesses are/were locally owned by BLACK business owners. They had signs up saying, ‚Äúplease don‚Äôt destroy our property, this is a black owned business.‚Äù 

What did they do? Destroyed the entire fucking street for weeks on end. After being somewhat rebuilt over a couple day period, they did it again and half of the businesses permanently closed their doors. City leaders and pastors were begging people to stop robbing their own communities. Did they listen? Fuck no. 

They annihilated every business on that street for days and days until damn near the entire police department stood post on every corner for weeks on end. So no, miss revolutionary, this isn‚Äôt reparations. You‚Äôll have a very, very difficult time convincing me that using the murder of a man at the hands of police in Minneapolis to come up on drugs at a pharmacy, sneakers from shops, and annihilating any economic opportunity for your neighborhoods is anything but *pure ignorance and selfish materialism.* You aren‚Äôt Rosa Parks, you want attention and shortcuts. 

Also, on the insurance point: Many shops had NO insurance for their property or business, and the ones that did were only given checks once and then canceled their policies because the damage was coming in waves and they‚Äôd get round after round of destruction. This lady is something else. What a shitty human being. 

Fucking disgusting.

Of course many non-European troops fought under the banner of European powers, both in Europe and overseas. On balance I'd still say it was a European war - but I'm not American so using 'white' for everything just sounds strange.

N.B. the Ottomans had been involved in European affairs for centuries, and had until very recently still ruled much of the southern Balkans. Hence I'm disinclined to discount them as a 'European' power, even if most of their territory was confined to Asia by 1914.

The Second World War was a true world war, perhaps the first true one because non-European powers and geopolitics were as prominent as non-European ones. 'Globalised' European wars like WW1 stretched back almost to the dawn of colonialism so it was more of a novelty in degree than kind."

Maybe if we were taught what complete and utter bastards we have been at times in the past, we might have more humility and empathy towards other people.

The African front in WWII started with Italian forays into Ethiopia in 1932 and Italian forces testing out modern chemical weapons and slaughtering Ethiopian forces that were still not using gunpowder as weapons. The Italian anxiety during this time is that they were fully left out of the European colonial projects that were enriching their peers. 

Germany‚Äôs nationalist movement beginning in the 1890s had a similar motive - the ‚Äúlebensraum‚Äù movement looking for space and resources to expand was fueled by the anxiety that they couldn‚Äôt compete with Naval powers accessing the rich resources colonial expansion offered. 

Post WWII, one of the major changes globally was the first stage in transition to what the UN called ‚Äúthe mandate system‚Äù, graded in three stages based on capacity for self governance and rule.

You may also be familiar with the term ‚Äúthird-world‚Äù - initially utilized by Egyptian leader Nasser in the 1950s, describing a growing desire of countries outside of the white, Western/Eastern, capitalist/communist, first/second world conflicts that harmed their people without providing any of the gains that the other two axes of power enjoyed.

Both World War I and II were launched due to the economic and political anxieties that the losers in the colonial system felt.

7759,Politician in California blames catalytic converter theft on Toyota for making them easy to steal,1294,facepalm,12xo7z3,https://v.redd.it/n9ld0c8ezuva1,332,"The issue is not that they're easy to steal, but the value of the materials inside of the catalytic converter.  1st and 2nd generation Prius had an excess of precious metals put into the catalytic converters because the tech was new and they overshot what was actually needed.  Other manufacturers did similar things were their models.  They've since realized this (prior to the rash of thefts) and corrected it.  So, with that said, by the time these thefts began, these cars were already WELL out of their warranty period.  There was no part defect or safety concern, so it becomes the consumer's problem, not the manufacturer. 

I like to compare it to the 90s when hood ornaments were being stolen.  Nothing to do with a safety issue or defect, just people wanting them and ease of access.  Manufacturers stopped putting them on the hood as a result.  Catalytic converters can't just be moved to some other part of the vehicle if it's already designed to be on the undercarriage. 

It really comes down to...it's YOUR car.  You have insurance for things like this."

You need to tell him that couples therapy (and/or individual therapy) needs to happen today and he needs to learn to say no to her.

She is \_not\_ living with you. Threats of not coming to the wedding seem to be all she's got and it seems that her missing it would bother her more than it would bother either of you. 

If it's just a lot of unpleasant noise, maybe you can find ways to stay clear of her unpleasantness. Therapy helps people deal with people who don't go to therapy. It could help you get clarity with your husband about how much he agrees with his mother's expectations and what strategies you can use in the future.

If he needs a perfect family, he has the perfect opportunity to build one of his own with you.

Your MIL acts the way she does because there are no consequences for the things she says and does. A few days of silence is not a consequence, it's a time for her to come up with newer and better manipulations to punish you both with. If you and your husband want to make an impression about how you feel about the way she treats you, you will have to say it to her face. And then put her in time out for a couple of months to give her time to perhaps grow up and learn how to adult.

I would strongly recommend marriage/family counseling for you and your husband. A therapist can help you develop effective ways of communicating with her that even someone with her limited intellect can understand. And, that same therapist can help your husband learn how to confront his mother without succumbing to the guilt she's such an expert at laying on him."

While you have married into this, he‚Äôs been likely conditioned to understand that this is *normal* for his whole life and this is just ‚Äúthe way she is‚Äù. 

He‚Äôs probably carrying some trauma/baggage from his childhood and has a pretty big guilt complex he‚Äôs developed over the years. 

Her behavior is obviously not ok and your husband needs to set and enforce boundaries with her. This isn‚Äôt going to ever get better unless your husband is able to stand up to his mother and call her bluffs.

Just to be clear, I‚Äôm not saying your husband isn‚Äôt at fault for not standing up to his mom. At some point, he needs to realize how her behavior is impacting you and your marriage and prioritize what is most important to him. He might just need some professional help to approach the situation from a different perspective."

The reason is your husband. A lot of people have crazy MIL and yet they still consciously choose their wife to be their priority. It tells a lot about his character.


Your husband is not good for you or any partner he will ever have until he understands where is his problem, but he's too old for you to give him the benefit of the doubt. 
He needs to understand the consequences of his actions and when he will realize it may won't be with you, because you can't help him anymore. Maybe get a therapist but if it's a deal breaker for you don't waste time hoping he'll change on his own.


If you really love him and you decide to quit him because you judge it's a real deal breaker, tell yourself that it was the only manner for him to have maybe a shock that will open his eyes and maybe he will be able to change for an other woman before it's too late for him in life.

I would highly recommend going low contact if not no contact with this woman because what she is doing now, will only get worse when you have children. You think she has 0 respect and is manipulative now? 

This stuff will affect him alot more than he recognises and even let's on because he has spent his entire life dealing with her and her nasty, narcissistic ways. My mother was the same sort of person. Rotten and nasty. Couldn't just be happy and if you had achieved something, the only praise you would get for it would be if an outsider was around, and at that point she had already put on her sickly sweet mask. Its hard. You know the behaviour isn't right or normal or healthy but you feel stuck, caught in a catch 22. But when you break that abusive cycle they have you trapped in, yes, it takes a while to heal, and you recognise how wrong some of what happened was. But that crushing weight you carry...it lifts...makes you feel like you can finally breath.

He may be worried about what she would do if he did try going Lc or NC. And it does sound like Stockholm syndrome in a way. I woukd suggest some therapy for him. So he can atleast talk about his feelings regarding his mother and maybe even some marraige counselling if you think you needed it. Because, to me, for you to feel the way you do, it could be impacting on your relationship already. The fact you see her as a threat to your marraige to? It isn't healthy. It could also help either your communication as a couple."

Assuming you are not willing to let the current status quo continue indefinitely, that leaves you with two options:

1. Be the one who stands up against her, protecting your husband every single day until he can stand up against her himself. However, even if he agrees to this  approach, do not expect him to be happy about it every day, so be aware that you will probably put as much time into fighting him and keeping him on track as you will dealing with her crap. At some point, probably a few years down the line, he might have made enough progress to be able to give you a break from that role. Or the marriage will be over by then.
2. Walk away before making any further serious commitment to your husband (I am thinking children) you put any more effort into the dumpster fire of a family that your husband is coming from.

Even if you decide that option 1 is the one you want to go with, you can always change your mind; while even if option 2 is the one you decide on, talk it through with your husband first to see if there is even the slightest inkling of him having the backbone to stand up to her.

Also, sorry about the poorly behaved tourists. Most Americans don't get the chance to travel abroad, and the ones that do only usually go abroad a couple of times in their life, so their ""foreign traveler"" skills are usually pretty poor. They also don't get much practice in North America, since Canada is very similar to the US and the places that Americans visit in Mexico/Caribbean are usually heavily-tourist geared resorts/locations."

Just for the record, ANY human is allowed to refuse ANY physical contact. If it makes you uncomfortable to be patted on the head, you CAN set that boundary that he shouldn‚Äôt do that. It doesn‚Äôt have to be sexual contact for you to be uncomfortable and to tell him so. I guess if you‚Äôve been around that for years, it might have started when you were a kid‚Ä¶ kids can easily be swayed that it‚Äôs ‚Äònormal‚Äô and therefore their discomfort doesn‚Äôt matter. Unfortunately.

And absolutely keep him away from your child - as I said, kids can‚Äôt always defend themselves. And make sure you teach your child about ‚Äòmy body my choice‚Äô and that she can say no to any and all physical contact any time she is uncomfortable, and you will ALWAYS back her up. 

And then try and teach yourself that, too. This man has been doing something you don‚Äôt feel comfortable with for years, and you‚Äôve talked yourself out of defending yourself‚Ä¶ but you can still teach yourself TO defend yourself. 

You don‚Äôt have to put up with being patted on the head - I know many people do that to little kids (some little kids don‚Äôt mind), but for an adult, that‚Äôs incredible creepy anyway! You‚Äôre not a pet or a small child, are you? üòû"

If you're leaving the area when you leave, you could also give your local police department a heads up that you're leaving voluntarily so they can't use the police to try to track you down by reporting you as a missing person. Make sure they can't track you with your phone.

Close any accounts you had before, in case they try to use them. Below is a link that explains what you need to do to freeze your credit.

[https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/finance/how-to-freeze-credit](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/finance/how-to-freeze-credit)

If you have any problems getting your documents, you can request your own copies, usually for a fee. Contact the county health department where you were born for a birth certificate. Contact Social Security to get a new SS card. Contact the U.S. Department of State for a replacement passport. If you have a state issued photo ID, a lot of this will go more smoothly. 

If you don't have a state issued ID, con your parents into helping you get one. You can get one without your parents, but it can take more time and documentation.

Ideally you know where everything you want to take with you is located so come Monday you can gather it all quickly and leave.

When did this entitled, oblivious-to-reality mom send out this ridiculous request? 

First, you have to make sure all the other moms are on the same page, and discuss how to handle this, (hopefully with the most embarrassment to entitled mom, and none to the innocent child). 

You can simply send out a letter to all, especially her, that for holidays everyone picks a name and buys a gift for only that person, with a strict and reasonable price range (such as $5-$10). Or if this class actually has kids buying  gifts for the entire class for every holiday, everyone should spend 250 cents on the gifts for this kid instead of 250 dollars. 

Alternatively, everyone should send the same crazy request for $250+ gifts from this mom for their kids. It doesn‚Äôt have to be something they really want, just something to torment the entitled mom with. (My precious really wants XYZ that costs $600. You can get it for her for her birthday, Thanksgiving, and part of Christmas, and get her something only $150 for the rest of Christmas)"

Be proud of yourself for what you‚Äôve accomplished so far. And be kind to yourself if you missed the mark on something. We learn the most from our mistakes, so you might not have achieved what you‚Äôd hoped by you still learnt something and most importantly you took the chance and tried.

She hoped we'd always be close but she didn't consider a chore of mine to take care of them in old age or anything like that. She also said that parents usually get the kids, they deserve, meaning that if the parents were assholes, it was no wonder that the kids wouldn't want anything to do with them.

Well, I adore my mom to this day and after she was diagnosed with cancer again 1¬Ω months ago, it was obvious that I'd go be with her and take care of her if needed. She's both my mom and a best friend and I enjoy every minute we're together.

My dad died in 2016 and I have struggled with not feeling like ""enough"" for him for my entire life. It was only like a year ago when I talked with my mom about how he used to take in all the ""lost boys"" who had fathers who were hard on them. I finally realized that even if I had been a boy (he never gave a hint about being disappointed I was a girl) he would have treated me exactly the same because that's what men did in his generation. It was so weird to me that he on the one hand felt for these poor boys almost getting bullied by their own dads and never saw that he wasn't much better. He didn't bully me like your dad but he was never openly proud of anything I did and would also criticize other men who praised their kids too much, he considered that bragging and an embarrasment. 

This realisation REALLY set me free! It had nothing at all to do with whether I was good enough or not, it was all about generational aspects and culture. I could have become the prime minister of my country and he wouldn't have expressed how proud he was.

Your dad doesn't have the mental capacity to see the great things about you. It's a him-problem, not a you-problem. YOU, on the other hand, will have to live with yourself for the rest of your life - make sure you make yourself the priority in it instead of a silly man with limited capabilities and who probably couldn't ever be won over anyway."

Ultimately that is sort of how it depends in your family. If you never got gifts before, don't. And to be honest, if he's pushing for a gift, don't either. It's meant to be a pleasant thing you do for them, not a demand.

But a nice card is also a gift! But no, etiquette-wise there is zero social obligation for anyone (outside of, perhaps, the couple themselves) to give gifts. You OWE him nothing. 

Where we get into issues with this kind of thing is with *expectations* of gifts. As an adult I don't even expect gifts if I throw myself a birthday party. I'm thrilled with a cute or funny card. 

Our culture (I'm American) has come to expect gifts in various scenarios like weddings and birthdays, but truly there is no real obligation to give a gift ever. An exception could be made for showers (bridal, baby, etc.) where the entire point of the event is to give gifts. 

If you'd like to poke the bear you could certainly give your parents an anniversary gift. One aimed specifically at your mother that you know she would love! Thereby meeting his expectation of receiving a gift without actually giving him a damn thing!

You are the most important member of your children's team absolutely.  They were wrong to promise you those things for son 1 though.  The bigger he gets, the harder he is to understand when he is hurting other students and destroying things.  They may know what to do, but if there is another staff member there who is not familiar with him, or he does something unpredictable, something dangerous can happen.  I cannot understand for the life of me why anyone agreed why if he ran (as is common for children on the spectrum) that he was allowed to run away.  Elopement is so dangerous, and kids could end up tripping and going down the stairs, or running out into the parking lot or into the street.  In the US, if they were not able to honor his needs, and provide him with a proper education in a least restrictive environment then they should have paid for him to go to private school and you would have every right to go to due process to make sure he gets that.

Your mom is 100% projecting. She's more concerned with having a biological grandchild that she doesn't care about your health, your quality of life or the struggles you have to endure daily. It's all about you providing her with she thinks she deserves. 

Next time she says this, I'd turn it right back around on her. Does she want to be sad and lonely as she gets older because her only biological kid will no longer talk to her? Because that's the slope she's currently on.

FYI, it can be difficult to get sterilization procedures when you are in your 20s and don‚Äôt have any children yet. So when you talk to your Dr about it, start with the fact that you couldn‚Äôt safely provide care for a child.  You wouldn‚Äôt be able to safely carry them, feed them, or even change their diapers.  This reasoning makes it easier for Dr to get the procedure approved by insurance.

If you had a child, she'd abuse it just as she abuses you. That alone is reason enough never to give her access to any grandchild, step, adopted, or bio.

I'm so sorry that you got such a cruel person as a mom. Please, please take care of yourself. You are precious and worthy just as you are. 

I'm sending hugs (that don't touch your painful side) if you want them."

When I first started dating him my dad accused him of stolen valor!! My husband was in the military but medically discharged and my dad, who was also in the military and discharged.. uh.. not honorably.. accused him of straight up lying about ever serving at all. I was dumb back then and actually believed that my dad somehow knew something I didn‚Äôt and started to believe that my boyfriend was lying to me about serving. He took it like a champ though and just casually dug out a mountain of evidence. Pictures, ID cards, yeah not that hard to prove you were in the military when you were. But my dad had successfully sowed those seeds of doubt and it took a long time for me to truly fully trust my boyfriend. Ever since being with him, and honestly seeing what an amazing father my husband is to his kids.. I‚Äôve realized what a shit dad I have. I watch my husband spend every moment he can with his kids‚Ä¶ help them with their homework, give them real life advice, hang out with them casually, discipline them, guide them, laugh with them, give them everything they could possibly need, he *shows up* for his kids consistently and daily and it makes me think about how absent my dad was for me growing up. 

The final straw for me was when my dad said my boyfriend was ‚Äúclearly a horrible father because he doesn‚Äôt have a car so how can he see his kids?‚Äù And I LOST IT on him. I said he doesn‚Äôt have a car and yet manages to see his kids almost every single day. He gets them on and off the bus, he is there in a heartbeat when they call him, he FINDS ways EASILY because he WANTS to be there for them, car or not. It‚Äôs a non-issue in his parenting. So I called my dad out HARD. I said YOU had a car when I was growing up, and yet I only saw you once a fucking year. Shut him right the fuck up. 

Then, 4 years later, I told my dad I was getting married to this man he has tried so hard to trash on. And idk if he just finally realized he wasn‚Äôt going anywhere or what but he finally accepted him. I‚Äôm sure he still has his complaints but if so he keeps them to himself now. 

Moral of the story is.. who gives a fuck what anyones parents think. These boomers can be miserable petty assholes and unfortunately that‚Äôs just the mindset of older parents these days.

So here‚Äôs how it went down (I‚Äôm gonna refer to him as G because he doesn‚Äôt deserve to be called Dad):

Me: Hi dad

G: Didn't get the text till this morning. Hello

Me: Have you thought of me since graduation?

G: I've thought about u everyday since way before graduation. Hope you're doing well.

Me: I'm trying. I really am. But we need to talk about what happened between us if you want to move forward. I was already bullied in school for my interests and who I am. The last thing I wanted was the same treatment from my dad

G: You tell me. You called your mother on a Saturday or Sunday morning from my house on a weekend a had you to pick you up. I still to this day don't know why other than maybe you just wanted to go home or didn't want to be at my place. You've left me out of your life every since.
I've never bullied because who you are. You know that's a fact.

(Omg now he‚Äôs playing stupid. After all these years it hasn‚Äôt hit him.)

Me: Are you serious? 8 years later and you still don't know? You've yelled at me over something stupid and I felt unsafe. Then after I called you told me you couldn't believe I was your daughter. If that was how you felt then what was the point of going back? You've called people who I looked up to freaks. I'd always get scared that you would yell at me and when you'd drink. We would always fight. I felt like I can't do anything and I was walking on eggshells and some things had to be in secret. (The secret I‚Äôm referring to is my mom took me to a pride pageant and my dad thought I was performing at church. He somehow found out.)

G: I'm not going to argue with you. Truly sorry you felt or feel that way. If you wanted a relationship with me you would've reached out a long time ago.

Me: This isn't an argument it's the truth.
I could say the same thing about you. You abused mom, verbally abused me, and you put your drinking over people around you. You probably wouldn't accept the fact that I am a bisexual witch who's liberal and who listens to a satanic band. You probably wouldn't show up to my wedding if I had a girlfriend. I hope you get the proper help that you need and that you take care of yourself. I genuinely mean that. If you're not gonna accept responsibility and continue to blame me or mom, then what's the point. Btw, cousin tyler took advantage of me when I was a little girl. But you probably wouldn't believe me. I'm not gonna change who I am. And I'm sorry if that hurts you. But I'm done. I wanted to tell you I went to a shinedown concert last night, but obviously reaching out was a mistake. Please take care of yourself. You abused mom right in front of me and you didn't even bat an eye. If you actually took responsibility and get help and get sober, you would be in my life right now. At the end of the day it's not my responsibility to have a relationship. You're not only the adult, you're the father

G: Great band Shinedown. Luv em
(Bro really said DODGE)

Me: And now you're ignoring what I just said. Cool

G: No not ignoring. Not going to debate or argue. After all, your never wrong. I remember that.
(Dude BFFR)

Me: Excuse me? I never said I was never wrong. This isn't a debate or and argument. This is what happened. You need help. All I said was you need to own up to what you did. Gaslighting isn't gonna get you anywhere

G: Never mind. Take care of yourself. By the way, you still have health, dental, and vision insurance for 2023.
(Is that a threat? Is he trying to hold insurance over me? HA! I threw a soft ball and he fucking struck out üòÇ)

Me: I have been. I hope someday you can live without alcohol and hurting others and act like an adult. But until that day, I'm gonna continue living my life

G: It's been 8 years. How do you know me now?

Me: That's what I was gonna ask you Gary

G: Good question isn't it Samantha.

Me: I guess for you you're still petty. You know what? Lose my number. I'm done. One day l‚Äôll be hot shit, and you won't be able to contact me

G: There you go going off. Get the mental Health you need. Still love you. Not petty.
(Y‚Äôall, the projection is REAL!)

Me: Are you done projecting Gary? You're an alcoholic who abuses people who care about you. I have been getting help unlike you

G: Like I said. And you. It's been 8 years.

Me: And you still haven't change and probably won't. Not even for your only living child

G: Still love you.
(Yeah right)

Me: Sure you do üòí

G: Really do! 

Me: Uh huh

My mom knows I tried my best but he‚Äôll never admit any wrongdoing. She knows it wasn‚Äôt my responsibility. It‚Äôs not my fault. Before going to bed, I sent one final message to him and then I blocked his number:

Me: I'm blocking this number now. You've shown you're never gonna apologize to either one of us. Remember when you told me you couldn't believe I was your daughter? Well I can't believe you're my sperm donor. You wanna know what your problem is? You'd like to think of yourself as the victim. Well you've put me and mom through hell and I can tell you right now that you're not. In fact maybe you'd be able to sleep better at night if you just admit that you're a coward who drinks all his problems away and who doesn't care about who he hurts. That's you. Don't come to my wedding if I ever have one and don't come around my children if I ever have any. I never wanna see you again. I never even wanted you at graduation. I'm tired of being nice to you because you're my dad when you caused a lot of trauma. Have the life you deserve. Never contact me again.

(I know I used a Bojack reference in this one but I thought it was fitting lol üòÇ)"

A little bit of a backstory. 

My mom and dad are divorced. He never treated my mom with the respect she deserves and he abused her to the point where he hit her right in front of me and gave her a black eye. He even cheated on her before they even got married. I was only 5 years old. 

After the divorce, my dad called the neighbors that helped her pack her things and said ‚Äúthanks for helping that bitch to get out.‚Äù Then I had to go to supervised visits and then had to go see him every other weekend. 

He would occasionally try to make my mom the bad guy by saying they couldn‚Äôt get along, my mom buys me clothes that are too small, and that she took a photo of my messy bedroom and posted it on Facebook (which she never did). 

He‚Äôs a raging alcoholic. He was never a role model. He‚Äôd give me a vape or an e cigarette to smoke and told me not to tell mom. He‚Äôd also took me to a bar when I was so young I didn‚Äôt even know you had to be 21. I was 11-12 years old at the time. 

I was getting severely bullied in school for my interests and who I am and I was getting the same treatment from him. He called people I looked up to freaks. He‚Äôs extremely homophobic and racist. He‚Äôd always say the Adam and Eve BS and he told me that if I ever date a black guy it would make me look like a slut. 

His whole family is a freak show. My cousin even took advantage of me when I was a preteen by grabbing my arms and yanking me and French kissing me. My grandmother (paternal) even called me fat. 

We‚Äôd always fight for stupid reasons. He can‚Äôt even keep a girl because of the way he treats them. 

The last day I spent with him was on a Saturday and he was yelling and we were arguing and he said ‚ÄúI have one child that‚Äôs dead (my half brother) and one that can‚Äôt behave.‚Äù I told him I lost my appetite after he said he brought me McDonald‚Äôs and his response was ‚Äúyou make me lose my appetite.‚Äù 

I texted mom what was going on and she told me to pack my things and tell him she was coming to get me. After I told him he tried to bribe me by saying we would see one of my friends. Then he gave up. While I was sitting on the couch waiting my dad said to me ‚ÄúYou know what Sam? I can‚Äôt believe you‚Äôre my daughter.‚Äù That showed me that I made the right choice that day. 

My mom picked me up and had an argument with my dad outside of his gate from her car. I remember her telling him things like ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think you can be nice to her for 48 hours.‚Äù I was 13 at this time and I stopped visiting him. 

He would send me birthday cards on rare occasions but one time he thought I was turning 17 when I was actually turning 18. The very last time I say him was at my high school graduation. He looked unrecognizable and I guess his drinking and smoking got so bad his teeth turned yellow to the point where they look wooden. I never wanted him there but I guess that means more money for me lol. 

My family tries to convince me to send a birthday card but I would refuse. My grandma (maternal) thinks I‚Äôm just holding a grudge. 

I‚Äôm 21 now and honestly I wish I‚Äôd left him sooner, especially after what happened last night. I went to a Shinedown concert with my boyfriend on Wednesday and I found it funny because Shinedown was my dad‚Äôs first concert and my mom took him and now their daughter was going to see them. And that what led up to the conversation that ended with me going off on him"

If I had gone in full force with her, the way you did w/your father, we never would have reached a point of healing.

I am so sorry that your relationship with your brother has basically ended for now because he is a nasty drunk and your parents enable him. 

I agree with several other posters to consider going NC for now. 

And I suggest do not tell them about the baby.  You just do not need a bunch of drama in your life at this time.  Focus on relationships that make you happy and envisioning your little nugget. You can decide if you want to tell them later after the baby is born.  

If you decide later to let your parents be in your child‚Äôs life I strongly urge you to allow absolutely no unsupervised visitation with your mom so your child is never exposed to your brother being a volatile uncontrolled drunk.  

No matter what your mom says you know she is an enabler so unless some great epiphany smacks her upside the head and they get your brother to stand on his own 2 feet he would be around.  And if he is drunk and raging your baby could get hurt. 

Also how exactly do your parents think your brother will carry on in life after they have passed?  My suspicion is they will expect you to take him in which would be a big fat no."

 how I am. Are you putting in as much effort trying to change who she is

Of course they aren't putting effort into trying to change your brother, because he won't change. You, on the other hand, are reasonable so they can ask you to sweep his behavior under the rug as they do. A big fat nope to that.

You may wish to consider checking out Al-Anon, a support group for families and friends of alcoholics. Even if you are NC with him, it may give you some reassurance, plus some help with coping with any flying monkeys who try to pull you back into the family dysfunction.

It is super disgusting that your family is coddling and protecting him and making excuses for him because that's 100% what it is. 

And I also can empathize with how frustrating the situation is for you. Of course you're not the asshole here anyone with a brain can see that. 

But that is such a difficult position to be in where somebody is being enabled and it's then destroying your relationship with their enablers. From reading this clearly your relationship has deteriorated to the lowest point it could be with your brother but because of the way your parents (mom but I assume both M&D to a degree if they all live in the house together) has been deeply affected your relationship with your parents by proxy. 

It sounds like you are in a relationship where you're supported and valued and that's really important, I'm really sorry for how difficult your relationship has become with your family because of someone's addiction exacerbating things. 

Whatever you end up doing for your own mental health sake Im sure it will be the right choice for you. Family is such a tough thing and it is not a right it is a privilege. I really hope one day your parents have enough with your brother and kick him out because he's not going to change while he's being enabled like this.  Alcoholism is such an awful addiction. 

Sorry op, nta but that is a shitty situation to be in. Congratulations on your rainbow baby üåà

There are plenty of places on Long Island that are affordable, but you do need a car if you're off the main bus roads.

While I have brought my children with me before to a job, I first had a walkthrough without them present and had received permission from the home owner if I could bring them beforehand so we didn't have to reschedule when childcare fell through one day.  When we arrived, I brought their tablets and headphones, laid down ground rules to them, showed them where the bathroom I would be working in was, and then they quietly sat in the living room as I worked.  

What you experienced is so disrespectful and obviously a continued pattern within that family with how they all reacted.  Next time you inquire about a service, make sure they are ""licensed and bonded"" so if something is damaged such as using the wrong cleaner on granite counter top, they do have insurance that'll cover it.  IIRC, bonded only applies if it's not a solo employee as it refers to their insurance covering any employees they hire.

Edit: also, where you repeatedly mention shoes, you can always ask before a walkthrough if they'll please use shoe covers before entering."

And in case anyone is wondering, no, it‚Äôs not any single racial group; I‚Äôve seen it across all racial groups. It has to do with a sense of detachment that I sense from the parents. It‚Äôs like gaydar but for misbehaving children."

I'm the only one who is walking away with the understanding OP has 4 kids, another on the way. Yet, she has her kids books alphabetically organized, every toy has its place, everything is organized.
Suspicious. What's The real answer? 1-4? üòÇ

1: this is a 1 time thing when people are coming over. (totally done it. I have no shame. I'm amazing at mom cleaning.)

2: They don't play with them very often. (The ones my kid don't play with doesn't move from their original spot. That's how I know I can get rid of it without her noticing.)

3: You are a neat freak. (I'm not at all. I have a ""lived in"" cluttered house. My mom would die all over again if she knew that I didn't pick up and put away the couch blankets every night before going to bed.)

4: You have the most well behaved kids ever. Do you have the unicorn children? The ones that actually listen and do what you say with the organizing? I hear they are very elusive. 


 My brother has one of those too depending on the mood of the day. Mine? Not so much. I'm happy if it's our of the way and in the toy box. I don't have organized areas though. I gave up on them. The small parts just ended up collecting there. 

I do appreciate you on making your kids pick up after themselves at someone else's house as one mom to another. I have stopped my friends from leaving to make their kids pick up because it's not fair to my kid."

You were strong enough to come out publicly. You WIL be strong enough to deal with whatever comes your way! 

Think of how nervous you were when you first came out and changed your name. You made it through that, right? 

Your parents couldn't stop you then, and they can't stop you now. All they can do is mouth off. It won't be comfortable,  but in 2 years, your transition should be complete, and your college, too. You will have all the freedom you need to be happy because you will move out. 

I know that sounds like a long time, but it will go by faster than you think! 

Spend your time setting goals for yourself. They can be short-term or long-term. This will remind you of who has the ultimate control over you. And it will give you things to daydream about when your mom is on a roll. 

Some parents do not like losing control of their kids. Your mom obviously doesn't like the idea at all. But she is not in control of you regardless. 

Find people, even if it is online, that have transitioned and talk to them about their experiences.  We all know the way your mom acts is wrong. Hearing the experience of others can help it sink in. It is also a way to make friends that can last a long time!

You sound like you love your dad very much and simply miss him, even though he's technically still there.

I've read all the other comments and I agree that being accused of such a horrible thing by your sister probably made whatever issue he had already going on (since you said he's been distant even before) even bigger. I don't know how your dad grew up, but different generations handle emotions differently. My dad (53) shuts down completely, for example, when faced with grief. He won't let it show. But he's also bad at showing positive emotions. On the other hand, he's big on random acts of kindness, it's his love language.

I guess my advice (advice from a random person on reddit which you do not have to follow at all) would be to just show him you love him through any way you want. Also, maybe try to show some interest in his interests, like the Netfix shows he likes to watch. Maybe after a while he'll be less distant because now he feels like there is mutual ground between you.

But: don't put your own interests on hold, okay?"

Throw in that the brain damage you suffered has wiped out memories too. Let him KNOW you miss him and want him to be a bigger part of your life.

Damn, I guess that brain damage really took a toll on you...listen. regardless of if it is his child. He was just accused of reading his OWN DAUGHTER! Fuck his family! Are you kidding me!? How can he even stay in that house? I would've left so fucking quick. The people closest to him betrayed him in the sickest way possible. They used an event that ruins lives every day to destroy your dad. And thank you so much to your sister for adding more fuel to the whole ""She probably wasn't raped, she's probably faking it. You know how women are."" Line of thinking that is used to protect rapists. 


Fuck your sister, she is the worst. 



Honestly, if you and your family can't see why he doesn't want to be around any of you, then you are all part of the problem. You don't get to accuse someone of rape and then when you find out it isn't real, you can't expect things to go back to how they were.

You are definitely NOT going to give her the opportunity to hit him again! You absolutely DO NOT want him to grow up feeling like the only father he's ever known didn't prioritize him and his safety. You already know how badly that feels."

Yes, that is the entire point. You want to exclude her from your family. She is supposed to feel excluded!  
Your father needs to accept that his wife fucked up and there is nothing he can do to change that.  
If she were in any way or form sorry about it, that would at least be a start.  
But she is not, and that is the end of any discussion."

Maybe next time your dad gets in touch with you, which he will you can ask him about the above scenario.  As for saying that she is family that ship has sailed long ago.

Please hire security for your wedding because this toxic pos who is his wife will try to get in the wedding.  She is that insane that she will think she can get away with this at your wedding.

I wouldn't put anything past your step monster so glad you have changed the locks to your home.  Please be aware she is likely to start escalating her toxic behaviour as she seems to think the law doesn't apply to her.

It is good that your sister is not allowing your step monster and dad get away with their abusive behaviours."

You're doing the right thing. Your father asked if the RO was necessary. It must be, because the court granted it. Otherwise they would not have.

I'm not making excuses for your father, but he's between a rock and a hard place. He has to live with his wife. Being the kind of person she is, she would make his life miserable if he did anything other than support and defend her. She's obviously the alpha in their relationship. As long as he feels like he loves her and wants to stay married to her, he's going to take her side. It sucks. It's cowardly, but it is what it is. 

Congratulations on your upcoming wedding. I hope your father and his wife will respect your choice of not wanting them there. There is a bright side to them trying to crash the wedding. It would be a violation of the RO and you could have her arrested. I hope you'll come back and update us after the wedding. I also hope it's a boring update where you say there was no sign of your father and his wife.

One is the simple frustration of her having to work around the car owners plans. 

Part of it, and this is not unusual, is that she feels that her needs for the car trump your wants. And  your issues are wants as far as she is concerned. She is the REAL adult here, the parent so you, as her CHILD, should suck it up and plan around her. As your mother, she sees the car as more HERS than yours.....because, again, SHE is the parent here. The adulter adult, as it were.

Why doesn't she have a car?

I would, nicely, tell her that this situation is not sustainable and her anger/frustration towards you is unacceptable. You pay for the car and everything involving the car. It's yours and not a shared ""family"" vehicle. YOU are not her spouse. You have been very generous in allowing her to use it, putting wear and tear on it, there is also the financial risk involved that you bear. Yet, you have allowed all of that without complaint. Her getting mad is, honestly, out of line. To prevent further issues, you have three options:

1. She needs to buy her own car. 
2. You expect her to rent a car whenever you are going to be home because your car is no longer going to be available. 
3. Call a Cab/Uber/Lyft
4. She no longer is allowed to use your car. 

It's essentially a slap in the face for her to get mad that you dare to use your own car as you see fit. SHE needs to cater to YOU. This is not a natural dynamic between most parents and children. 

Let me ask you, when you were a teenager and driving the family car.....did they cater to you or were you expected to cater to them for using their car? No....it's not different. She's used to that car being at her disposal, in her mind it's more HER car than yours because she uses it more....plus, as your parent, you need to obey and cater to her. 

You two really need to have a talk....."

I was going to suggest you post a schedule on the fridge stating when you need the use of your car, but that is unnecessary. It's YOUR car, you shouldn't have to worry about not being able to use it at ANY time when you're home, especially because you're gone for work so often.

Your mom knows you won't change your passwords or create a new email account.  It's time to get defensive on this.  Passwords should be phrases with Capital Letters, random numbers, and special characters.  Get a new [live.com](https://live.com) account, gmail.com account, or yahoo.com account for your banking and credit report.  It's not that you need a new SS number it's that you aren't protecting yourself from being hacked by your mom.

The next piece of advice is to change banks, credit unions etc move to one that will do two-factor authentication with either Microsoft or Google Authentication.  Also, lock down your credit reports so no one can use your SS number for credit cards without proving it's you.  This is done by enabling security questions that only you would know not the ones your mom would guess like her maiden name, your grade school, and where you were born."

My friend grabbed her daughter, left a tip for the waitress despite them not having ordered yet and was rushing out the door.

My friend slaps her hand and hisses that no one asked her to leave, her daughter was having a really bad day, and she wasn‚Äôt going to subject her to an environment that was triggering her! The woman still wouldn‚Äôt move and just kept at it. My friend just shoved past her, conveniently allowing her very strong daughter to kick repeatedly at this woman as they went by.

Then if the cops DO manage to track you down to perform a ‚Äòwellness check‚Äô, you can show them the text you sent to mum on the day you left, making it clear she knows your goals and that your intent was to cut contact.

I wonder, though, if just disappearing is a good idea. It might be a good idea to leave a note so she understands that you're moving on and not just running away.

One of my friends did the same thing, left her ‚Äúparents‚Äù home and never came back, however, they harassed her at workplace, with known friends, at social media and even appeared at a geek convention where she was selling things and made a scandal there because of her leaving. My advice for you: Change phone number, change email addresses, delete your social media accounts and create new profiles and if you ‚Äúmother‚Äù knows your friends, make sure they won‚Äôt spill out your location. 

And something else. If it is on your possibilities, search for psychological help. Even when you are sure and determined about leaving, maybe you will feel overwhelmed about managing freely your own life or old wounds will be painful again.

Suggestions.

1. Contact your bank and any credit companies and state that no one else has any rights on your accounts. Especially not your parents, give their names and make them confirm they document that.

2. Do the same for your new leasing company, AFTER you sign the paperwork. Make them document that they are not allowed to even confirm you live there to ANYONE, especially your parents. 

3. Don‚Äôt sign the paperwork until you have walked through the apartment.  Take lots of photos and write up a ‚Äúpunch list‚Äù of all items that need fixed or of any damage, even minor. Provide that list with your contract and hand write on the contract that said list exists and how many items it has.

4. Use your cell phone to take photos of the document after you sign it.  OH, and initial every page not otherwise signed or initialed, but in a random spot, over printed text.  Decades of contracts and more than a few cases where someone tried to swap out just one page with new wording‚Ä¶

5. Get that free copy of your credit report.  This is offered because the rental company ran your credit.  Also, open a Credit Karma account and monitor it for a year or so. 

6. Lock your social security number after you‚Äôre settled in.  This will prevent your parents from doing anything. You can unlock it yourself if needed 

7. Maybe even lock your credit. 

8. Make sure all of your mail is transferred and all of your accounts too. Then register on the post office your change of address. Do that now if you already know your new address."

While I didn‚Äôt have any LGBT issues with my family it was an extremely toxic situation I ended up sneak out moving out of myself.

My tip is to pack as much as you can beforehand from spaces that aren‚Äôt visible - think drawers, closets, storage. Pack and move it somewhere at a friends or buy a $1 for the fist month storage unit while your family is out/at work.

That will leave lighter, big things you can get out quicker. Leaves less time for them to berate you during your move and try to call bluff/put you down/talk you out of it.

Cutting a parent out of your life is difficult, I did it myself years ago, I just wish I had done it years earlier than I did.

I'm now a parent myself so it hurts me to see estranged families. But then I'd never do to my kid what my own POS parent did to me, so in some cases it's absolutely necessary to cut of ties with toxic family members."

If you plan on going no contact then prepare to delete all your social media accounts, Facebook, Twitter, all of it.  Do not give them a way to find you.

If they pay for your phone leave it behind, get a cheap burner and find a low cost or prepaid plan until you can get better.

Be careful who you interact with, a friend with good intentions can lead the ones you left back into your life.

I just want to speak about you in the terms correct for you.

First and foremost, when you leave, you need to call your local police and warn them that you're leaving your parental home of your own free will, that you are legally of age to self-emancipate, and you have not been and are not being kidnapped but that your parents/mother may call and make such a claim as a way to try to force you to come home. Basically, let them know you have the legal right to move out and are doing so, and to tell your mother she has no right to know where you've gone to anymore.

Most mothers like yours will try that trick of calling police as a way of forcing you to come home. They've done it on people in their late 20s/early 30s. Your mom will *definitely* try it on *you*. By calling the police *first*, you pre-empt her attempts to force you back.

Make sure she's blocked on everything, all social medias, phone, *everything*, and that you have all your important legal documents with you like social security card (or whatever equivalent your home country has if you're not in the US), birth certificate, etc. If you missed getting any of these, don't panic though.

She endured her last few months in that house by treating her mother like a roommate or annoying coworker: polite, pleasant, friendly, but not allowing herself to get drawn into her mother's nonsense. 

It wasn't easy. She'd vent to me a lot. But with the help of therapy she was able to maintain her sanity until she moved out. 

You know what your mother is and is not capable of. Seek what you need elsewhere, and give her information about anything important to you on a need-to-know basis. Don't share anything you know will be twisted into something to hurt you with. When you talk about important matters, give her the short version and save the details for someone more trustworthy. 

Good luck."

You don‚Äôt. You actually live only when you are away from such mothers. When you are with them under one roof - you survive, it is not a life, it is a prison sentence with completely unknown date of release because you slowly run of will to live. 

> ruin her life

> kill herself

You will be surprised how easily she will live without you. She will demand attention, but they do not off themselves. 

> breaking her heart

No matter what you do she will not be satisfied, unless you will be her little obedient puppet. You are not her daughter, you are her hopes and dreams and a therapist. She does not see you as your own person, she already told you how you can feel grief, she decided for you even that. She does not see you, when she looks at you: she sees her best/possible self when you act nice and everything she hates when you don‚Äôt. 

Please read on narcissists and especially narcissistic mothers. r/raisedbynarcissists is a good place to start. 


The only way you can live with her and get your way is by becoming a good liar and an actor. Sadly, they themselves are in the way of a healthy family relationship. No human is capable to bend and not break while keeping them satisfied and themselves sane.

The difficult part is let aside all the good they occasionally do in order to see how abusive they actually are."

Good news is you‚Äôre grown now and can totally be on your own. The second year of university I had a job and opted to stay in my apartment that I had a year long lease in and continue working during the summer instead of going home. 

She‚Äôs abusing your love and preying on your fear by threatening you, it‚Äôs a manipulative and emotionally abusive move to say she‚Äôs going to kill herself. It sounds like despite your dysfunctional relationship you both still love each other very much. She will adjust. I have a much better relationship with my mother now that I don‚Äôt live with her.

By working on myself and how I react to others poor behavior I‚Äôve found a lot of peace. If she‚Äôs not a full fledged narcissist and is a victim of narcissistic abuse she may even see you taking time to heal yourself and improve yourself and be inspired to change as well. 

When dealing with her go full gray rock and pull back. Nothing is exciting. Everything going on in your life is mundane. You don‚Äôt respond to antagonizing, you appear to be the least reactive dullest person who ever existed - she‚Äôll get nothing and she‚Äôll eventually leave you alone."

Short term: Get a summer job.  Maybe start applying now. If you can't get one, then volunteer.  Or maybe you can do babysitting.

Longer term;  Apply to summer jobs that are on campus so you can stay there or are somewhere else.

When you are a senior in College, in the fall talk to people at the Career office about when you should be applying for jobs and use all the resources they have.

I am not sure who is paying for your college...but if it isn't her realize you are an adult and can spend time with who ever you want.  If she ever threatens to kill herself, call 911.  If she really would, then she will get help. If it is a bluff, then she will knock it off.

Strange ? And there is a lot of missing information. You work - but do you pay rent? What was your agreement with your mom? Do you still pursue an education? You mentioned a fiance - also living at your parents and paying rent ? 


If you live there rent-free what do you do with your money? 
A cheese cake handmade from the baker would be around 8‚Ç¨ here. If you can't afford that while working where does your money go? (Possible reason for frustration of your parents?) Why don't you pursue a different job and what is your long time plan? 


if you live rent free and save at least above 500 per month but still make the this cake is mine - what is your reasoning there? 
even if you pay rent and she takes pieces of your cake you should bite your tongue because it is her house and she can just show you the door at any time. Reddit may not like this but it is her home meaning her rules. if you have not where else to go you should think about if the 4 pieces of cake are really worth it. I am not saying it is okay of her to take your things but I wouldn't risk being kicked out over cake. 



Also I don't get the stealing from family - even more if it is food. But then again I am from Poland and we stuff not only the people we love but also visitors and sometimes enemies (to make them shut up but still). 
Yes I would be annoyed if I looked forward to something and someone else would be eating it - but I wouldn't call it stealing if it were my mom or one of my kids. That just seems odd to me. But that may be a cultural thing."

You need to put yourself first. Parents may say they care for your best interest (‚Äúit will keep tou fit‚Äù) but in reality they are projecting their own insecurities and use you as a social therapy or something. 

If you do not feel good after their ‚Äúkindness‚Äù, it was not kind. If they make you feel tired and uneasy, you have all right to feel so. 

Think carefully and imagine she is not your mother, but some nosy neighbour. The amount if stuff you would tell you to mind your own business? You do not owe your family anything, just because they decided to have kids. 

If your mother does not care her action cause you physical pain, by definition this is abuse."

She has a lot of videos on identifying traits of a narcissist, what kind of narcissist you may be dealing with, and what to do with one or more narcissistic parents. It also helps to know if you're a scapegoat, invisible child, or a golden child and how their treatment of you changes depending on that. You may find it eye opening too.

 My significant other and I recently visited my parents for the first time in a couple years (2 for me and 3+ for my bf). My sister displayed psychopathic tendencies as a very small child and straight up tortured me with the approval and encouragement of my mother. The abuse from my mother was also nonstop for 18+ years. Even after years of no contact with my sister she's still using me to manipulate people and my family is trying to force her on me again. I am also never good enough for my mom and I'm pretty damn sure my sister could murder me and my mother would still love and defend her. I couldn't be alone with my parents on this trip because the abuse from my mom was extreme. She pretended to be a loving and supportive mom when other people including my bf was around, but it was only an act. I had a horrible medical issue while there and could have died. Her biggest concern was her image and said I ""just need to calm down"". You aren't alone in dealing with an asshole parent. Even as an adult it can be very difficult to break the cycle of abuse. Setting boundaries and limiting exposure are very important tools. Also understand that she will never change. If she is a narcissist like she sounds, she is not a normal logical person. She lives in a fairytale world."

First, can you make it clear to your sibling that ""sharing"" the birthday party is all your mom's idea and not yours? If your sibling will believe you and still loves you, that's important. Your sibling may be just as fed up with your mother's antics as you are, or maybe they will be when they get a little older, and it's good to know that others feel the same way you do.

Next, it's likely that the birthday attention will be focused on the younger sibling anyway. That's how adults tend to be: in general, smaller kids get more attention.

We had some out-of-state extended family visiting near my own birthday once; I was an adult by that time. Turns out, little kid of the visiting family had a birthday very close to mine. I was asked if I would mind sharing what was originally supposed to be my birthday party with the LO. That was fine with me -- took the focus right off me and put it on kiddo and that's how this introvert prefers it.

About the possible shopping trip: if the mall has a store that carries the things you want, could you go there while your sibling shops in the toy store? That might get you what you want without taking anything away from your sibling."

He does sound controlling and like he could use some anger management classes.

He might not be aware that he is diabetic or pre-diabetic, and his blood sugar may be all over the place (there is a good chance that the visit took place during/after iftar, I realize, but the swings can be reason enough).   



So it may well be that he is controlling and a jerk, but it may also be that he is being *more* of a jerk for medical reasons.  It could also be other medical issues.  Inshallah he is fine and just being a jerk, which is bad enough, no one, least of all you or your family, would wish him bad health.  But he should be checked out.

> I was scared as a kid

this is not zero!! especially given he used violence against disabled non-verbal kid. what would you consider ""too bad""? it was bad even like this. Additionally. Have you ever considered, your brother is non-verbal because of your childhood, not due to his disability?

> just one thing i remember

Sounds like you do not remember much, which would be a perfectly normal sign of PTSD after childhood with violent screaming parent. Not sure what your mother did, but alcoholism also shows in bad behavior, so a lot of trauma for both of the kids here.

>  give my inheritance rights up

this alone is why he is a terrible entitled parent.

> disloyal

interesting words such parents use. It is a power related word: your disobedience of the hierarchy. it is not about being hurt, it is about betrayal, you not showing him respect. For such parents respect is not something they earn, but something they are entitled to by hierarchy (which imo is just obedience, and fear at worst, rather than any form of respect whatsoever).

> we never fostered any relationship with brother

You grew up neglected: your dad's behavior as an adult is never to be here when needed. I bet he was the same in your childhood. Neglect makes it difficult to learn to socialize. Your brother has extra issues, so maybe even if he feels bond to you, he never managed to show it to you so you would see it. I think if you met him right now you could tell if he missed you or not. Neglect in childhood robs you of learning the process of normal communication. If you want to bond with your brother, I think you should give it a try. Relationships can be restored (sometimes), and given his disability, he may cherish every person he knows stronger than you think, simply because he has limited connections.

> makes me a terrible person 

I understand you very well. I did not bond with one of my siblings at all, because i chose my mental health. I have no desire to have any relationship either, because i just do not cherish family bonds just because ""family"", and i never had even one proper conversation with them. It is fully your choice, and a disabled kid is a huge responsibility. It is difficult, but could be very rewarding, if you decide to try. Yet, if you cannot really handle it, it can be better to stay away for both of you (like in my case). But mending relationships after years of no communication is also possible. I never expected to have a good relationship with my other sibling after our childhood, but here we are, because she is actively working on herself to be a better person and acknowledge what she did years ago.


Your father is an asshole. You are traumatized young adult with mental health issues, who needs to prioritize his mental health more than anything, especially given that you've been struggling a lot with it recently.

r/raisedbynarcissists r/raisedbyborderlines r/emotionalneglect Some communities to check out. Both of you kids have been abused and neglected. This is a fact, not an assumption: physical violence, parent-alcoholic (even if she was perfectly nice), shouting matches, robbing (he manipulated you into giving your money to him).

> parent‚Äôs fault if a kid grows up to hate them

It depends, but in your case it is definitely not you in the wrong. Parents tend to think they did their best, regardless of how much damage they did. If a kid has anxiety and overwhelming stress instead of happily expecting to meet them, it is safe to assume parents did not do their job properly.

A Karren is bitchy to service representatives, your mom is trying to belittle you and your father just for existing. She also sounds like she might be an alcoholic, especially if she makes a habit of getting drunk and going off on you guys. 

It‚Äôs a terrible tragedy that some people cannot be mothers, just rent out their womb. A woman who could ever hate you for just being you is unworthy of the title of mom. There is nothing wrong with being gay honey, not a single god damn bloody thing. The only wrong thing is your mother being in such a black pit of addiction and anger that she thinks it‚Äôs fine to pour it into everyone else‚Äôs cup. 

This internet mom sends big big big hugs and love. One day you will be free from your mom and find a community that loves and supports you, so keep fighting to get there and don‚Äôt give up. Hugs!"

Flashback to when my alcoholic father tried to make amends to me. He did seem apologetic, and I tried to explain to him how difficult it was to cope with him when my siblings and I were kids. Either it didn't sink in, or he couldn't or wouldn't handle the guilt, because he ended up saying, ""But it really wasn't that bad, was it?"" I wish I had had the guts to tell him sure, it wasn't that bad for you, but yes, it really was that bad for me and my siblings. But the unspoken Rule Number One when we were kids was Don't Upset Daddy, and even as an adult, I couldn't bring myself break it.

For boundaries, you may want to check out the [book list](https://www.ssa.gov/number-card/replace-card) used by some of the support subs like r/JUSTNOFAMILY.

You didn't do this, she did it to herself, by knowingly breaking the law \*\*\*4 times\*\*\*. 

If you can, submit a victim impact statement to the prosecutor in her case, you contact the prosecutor's office and ask how you can do that, so they have extra information to use against her, because you're a repeat victim of the defendant, and you would like the court to know how you feel about having your life upended monetarily multiple times by this person.

Be a survivor instead! Tell the court how you feel they should address her bad choices - that as this is her 4th offense, a minimal sentence is not going to teach her anything. She obviously feels she can do whatever she wants and try to ruin your life - tell them that. Let the judge know how you feel, so they will take that into account when they sentence her."

Please stick with it. Many courts are still dealing w/ a backlog, due to the pandemic, in addition to the already slow process of court proceedings. It can be depleting on  every level. 

If anyone (including your mother) try to get you to back down, stating ‚Äò family‚Äô or some other such nonsense, please stay strong. You are the victim, NOT the perpetrator. You are simply allowing the natural consequences of her actions come to fruition.

For coping, you are best off talking to your parents (both, at the same time) about your studies and your plans for the future. Make sure they understand that being independent and financially well off will put you ""In a great position to meet men who you can relate to and who are successful"". This isn't the real reason you'd be making a life for yourself, but it should get them to see that ""Getting a boyfriend right now"" will make it harder for you in the future.

For the ""rat bastard"" advice, start looking at dating sites that are not in your country. Try to find one that is rather far from home, say South Africa or the Philippines. Make sure it is not only far away but the kind of place your parents may be very upset if you were to move to. Then start talking about the ""Great catch"" you are chatting with.

Once you do that and have no emotional connection to your mother‚Äôs opinions and needs, anything she says is water off a duck‚Äôs back and it will cease to cause you the emotional upheaval that it currently does.  

It‚Äôs about compartmentalising things, putting mom feelings in a little box in your brain and locking it away until you finally finish your studies, find employment, and move out.  Once you have the physical distance, you can open the box again, allow the emotional connection, and restart the relationship with strong boundaries borne of your extra maturity and life experience.

In the meantime, ditch the guy, and every time she starts on about you about boyfriends calmly say  something like ‚ÄúMom, I‚Äôm not going to talk about this with you, so please drop the subject.‚Äù and if she keeps on, shake you head as though you are disappointed in her behaviour, calmly walk away (go to your room and do something productive, take a walk around the block for some fresh air and exercise, etc).  If you maintain a mature and calm tone and body language then she can‚Äôt accuse you of being dramatic, or going off to sulk.  Your calmness will become second nature to react to her drama this way in no time.  When she‚Äôs not being a pain, talk with her as normal.  She‚Äôll get the message eventually.  Good luck."

My partner Is non binary and exclusively uses it/its pronouns and dislikes he/she/they, as it finds that's the best set of words to describe it's gender identity and personal relationship with gender.

But yes, in general, it's considered transphobic to automatically refer to one as ""it"" as that's a niche pronoun set that most would dislike, the same way effeminate men would find it insulting to be referred to as ""she"" and butch women can find it offensive to be referred to as ""he"". Basically, if you're going out of your way to use ones pronouns to affirm your own stereotypes, or assuming the pronouns of a GNC person in general, then you're a problem. Usually they/them is considered to be the universal set, like even if that's not your pronouns you wouldn't find that offensive as it's neutral.

HOWEVER, ambiguity aside if you don't KNOW ones pronouns, that wasn't actually the issue here. You DID know the actors pronouns, and told her, she then refused to use them due to a belief that isn't even true, and that is certifiable transphobia.

However biologically humans are born with male/female/hermaphroditic genitalia. That‚Äôs a fact. And after living lifetimes with this knowledge it‚Äôs hard for some to see otherwise in people. I‚Äôm absolutely not transphobic but I still have a hard time grasping it and flipping my English switch to accommodate. Paleontologically I see a female skeletal structure I naturally think female, a male skeletal structure I think male. All formed due to the hormones of gender assignment at birth and throughout puberty. Now I‚Äôm just speaking about thoughts inside my head not what I ever say out loud. This further leads me to formulate in my own head only that when I see what my mind perceived as a man wearing a dress and makeup representing themselves as a woman, my mind goes ‚Äúoh that‚Äôs someone who was born a male that feels more like a female so they are presenting themselves as female because it‚Äôs more comfortable to them‚Äù 

Which is fine!!!!! They are free to be who they choose to be! I‚Äôm in no way disallowing that as if I even could lol. 

But my comment here is that my old school brain already assigned their genitals they were born with. I‚Äôm just accepting it and moving along. 

In typing all of this out though I did come to the realization that I can‚Äôt compute why someone would feel something against their own biology but yet that has to be an allowable truth. Who‚Äôs to say what biology really is since it‚Äôs constantly changing due to natural selection and evolution advancing efforts. Maybe trans is just the next step in evolution? Humans being capable of altering their entire mindset to combat gender assignment at birth. The brain is a fascinating thing and I believe that it makes a person much more than any other organ. And we still know so little scientifically about it. 

I guess in writing all this out I just helped my old school brain overcome the idea that trans is confusing. It‚Äôs just the next step in evolution starting to peek out. 

Sorry for my ramble here. Hope I don‚Äôt piss anyone off. It‚Äôs just a hot topic and I‚Äôve been thinking about it a lot lately. Trying to figure out where in truth I stand. To provide some context. I‚Äôm a 45 year old woman. I‚Äôm lifetime bi and have been married to both a man and more recently a woman for 15 years. I‚Äôm currently dating a man again. I don‚Äôt see gender in terms of sexual preference. Everyone is just the same to me lol. Which is why I may have been battling so much with my understanding of trans. (Shit just had another realization there!) But I‚Äôm also very anti religion (it‚Äôs just a story written by humans from the throwbacks of mankind) I‚Äôm very scientifically minded and geared. And I was born and raised in the US. Washington specifically (so super liberal area though I‚Äôm fed up with the lot of them currently lol, but that‚Äôs another rant üòÇ)"

You're a fully emancipated grown adult woman living independently with no need of a guardian. There is zero reason for adoption. 

In my country, the estate is divided as per the will of the deceased unless the will is contested or the deceased dies intestate. If the will is contested there must be a valid reason such as dependency on the deceased by the person contesting it which hasn't been adequately allowed for in the will. The courts will decide the outcome and the lawyers will benefit until there's nothing left to divide to the beneficiaries.

Was your mother ever in any way dependent on YOU? I suspect not, except as a commercial paying tenant. She has no claim, and the step father even less claim. 

But you should consult your OWN legal expert in these matters and follow their advice on how to give effect to YOUR wishes in all these matters.

Maybe she has taken out life insurance in your name and hopes to gain from that? After all, what assets of yours is she trying to lay claim to in the event of your demise?"

How long has he been in your life?
Does he have any children of his own?
Do you have any significant assets OP?

If he adopts you it could be to your benefit. Because in some places the law says step children cannot inherit. Your mom might be looking out for you in some twisted way.


>she had helped me earn exactly 0% of it while also making my life 2000% harder. 

So she (they) provided you with zero support be it financial or emotional growing up? Because you say you are 32 and still in touch with them enough to move back and rent from them in an area where it's hard to find accommodation?

If you have no significant assets OP then your stepfather gains nothing from adopting you? He actually accepts you being eligible to inherit from him even if he or your mom are no longer together or, God forbid, anything happens to her."
